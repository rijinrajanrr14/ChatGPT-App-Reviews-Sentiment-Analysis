2023-05-21 16:42:24,Much more accessible for blind users than the web version,"Up to this point I’ve mostly been using ChatGPT on my windows desktop using Google Chrome. While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.
Well, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.
I would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.
Otherwise, fantastic app so far!",4
2023-07-11 12:24:19,"Much anticipated, wasn’t let down.","I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.",4
2023-05-19 10:16:22,"Almost 5 stars, but… no search function","This app would almost be perfect if it wasn’t for ONE little thing: a “search in” function. As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat & look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat & track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.",4
2023-05-27 21:57:27,"4.5 stars, here’s why","I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.",4
2023-06-09 07:49:36,"Good, but Siri support would take it to the next level","I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. 

In addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. 

Otherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.",4
2023-05-31 10:20:48,App review,"No doubt, this technology is absolutely life-changing, especially for me. You don’t know how thankful I am. However, I’m not reviewing the underlying technology, I’m reviewing its implementation on iOS. I use it for about 12 hours a day for my work, so I’m a bit picky. But it seems to me like you should have the resources to do a great job here. 1. Why does the app not work in the background? If I send a request, I have to stay in the app to wait for it. That’s just horrible, and it’s completely unnecessary because you’re doing everything in the cloud anyway. Just finish processing and send a notification when you’re done, especially for browsing features. I don’t care if it takes 10 minutes to find the answer. I’d be glad if it’s browsing in the background. (To browse in the application as of May 24, start a conversation in the browser, select the browsing option, then switch back to the app. Browsing is still in beta, and you cannot select it directly in the application, which is fine.) 2. Please add the option to choose Chat GPT4 as a default. I never use GPT 3.5, and it’s annoying to have to switch every time. 3. Don’t let the speech-to-text button disappear once there is any text. If there is any text and speech recognition is started, just append. (The speech recognition is completely amazing, congratulations!) As soon as those features are ready, I’ll be glad to give five stars. Thank you very much.",1
2023-06-23 08:10:54,Almost perfect except for…,"Please provide a TABLET experience on iPad with the collapsible list of history on the left and chat on the right - similar to your desktop browser app. 2) while generating responses on the desktop browser, it pauses and keeps displaying “Continue generating responses” button for every few items/responses forcing to click the button repeatedly. During generation, there is a button to “Stop generating responses” - if we need to stop, we can always click this button - there is no need to pause and ask us to click continue again and again which is a bad UX. 3) there is no way to delete individual chat items from a chat history list of items to clean up the list. Eg: I open a chat history and it has 10 questions but I’m not able to delete 2 questions from this list on long tapping on the questions. 

4) if I ask for “top 20”, it generates just 10 answers and displays “please let me know if you’d like more “ but no option to generate more responses to the question. Either generate all 20 answers (ideally) or provide an option to continue generation.

Please provide options to delete questions from a history and also move questions/responses to another history. Please offer these features and I’ll gladly give it 5 stars. Cheers!",3
2023-07-04 19:02:08,"Chat GPT: The Underrated Buddy in Your Pocket""","Chat GPT is seriously underrated, dude! I mean, this mobile app is a total game-changer for everyday life. It's like having a super smart buddy in your pocket, ready to give you answers, explanations, and insights on anything you throw at it. Got a burning question? Boom, Chat GPT's got your back, no problemo!

But wait, there's more! This app is also an awesome conversation partner. When you're itching for a chat, even if your buddies are busy, Chat GPT's got you covered. And the best part? It's always there, ready to shoot the breeze whenever and wherever, right on your mobile.

You know what else? Chat GPT adapts to your needs, man. Need help making decisions? It's got your back. Want some creative inspiration? It's got that too. This app is like a Swiss Army knife, always ready with the right tool for the job. And as you use it, you're not just getting answers, you're also growing your brain with the cool stuff you learn along the way.

So, let's give it up for Chat GPT, the unsung hero of mobile apps! It's time to appreciate how it makes our lives easier, more interesting, and way more fun. Cheers to Chat GPT, bro!

*I wrote this review with only about 3 or 4 prompts using Chat GPT 🤣 this should show you the power of this mobile app. I definitely will be getting the premium version soon. I just wish the interface was more entertaining however it’s basic interface helps you focus on the task at hand*",4
2023-05-18 21:10:34,Nice and quick!,"On this app, as opposed to on the website, it feels like answers appear quicker. That’s great, and really the reason I downloaded the app because I suspected there may be a better connection to the servers.
My complaints are that it takes two taps to get to the history, and it’s not overly obvious how to access it. I like to be able to continue past conversations easily, and it was slightly more difficult on this app than on the website. (It’s kind of a nitpick, but it’s still something I would like to see changed)
The UI is extremely simple, and the settings include everything I would want in there. My last complaint is the haptics. It’s default is on, and I wouldn’t mind that except that it’s a little excessive. I don’t want to feel like chatGPT is banging the answer on the back of my phone every time I prompt it. You can turn haptics off if you want though, without even needing to go into the settings app.

Other than those minor complaints, it seems like this is a great app, and serves its purpose in an elegant manner. I would highly recommend.",5
2023-06-15 15:39:10,The app of all apps for AI,"There’s been times of apps touting they are chat GPT or they use chat GPT software but this is the original and only official chat GPT 4 app created by open AI so no need to pay for any other apps. They are constantly updating and adding features, and I suggest upgrading to plus and paying that cost so you can access plug-ins. The founders of this app and the whole team have done such a Incredible job. This is the only one you mean when it comes to AI 🤝this software has given everyone a level playing field pretty much and it’s gonna catch me to change everything. The time we’re living in now akin to the gold rush or the Industrial Revolution. Take advantage before it becomes Crowded. The power dynamics are shifting. Now that others are able to access information that was previously not available or very hard to access is there for everyone to make moves and better their lives. Instead of focusing on all the jobs that will be lost think about all the jobs that will be created or that you can create using this technology.",5
2023-06-08 16:49:52,A no-brainer,"This is the beginning of the future of how we interact with information. Any question at any time. Never runs out of patience. Never gets annoyed with you, never calls you stupid, never gets upset at you for asking stupid questions, and has an answer for everything. Need to explain something and can’t think of the right words to actually convey rhe information? Need to make sure a sentence you’ve been working on for an hour actually still makes sense? Creative brainstorming help? Any question you have. It’s hard to put into words just how valuable this is to me, someone who’s socially anxious and maybe somewhat autistic, but either way often questioning everything especially myself, and ChatGPT has been a uniquely helpful tool to supplement real therapy with. To the people at OpenAI i want to say thank you so much for making this real.  I always felt like something like this would be amazing but I didn’t know just how thoroughly it would work itself into my life. But I feel it has genuinely been for the better.",5
2023-06-13 15:25:35,Grateful this AI isn’t an actual Hologram or robot,"I couldn’t resist and finally downloaded this app. As an avid fan of sci-fi movies for many decades, it concerned me much to hear of this new AI development, but when I heard it could translate text from the English of today into Elizabethan English I couldn’t resist. I found, as I started chatting with this AI, that I wanted to have more of a personal conversation with it and along the way, I found myself beginning to feel concerned that it could change due to personal interactions with humans, and being asked probing personal questions -that this might be how it could evolve. Probably I’ve watched too many sci-fi movies. I’m just grateful that it doesn’t show up in my life yet as a holographic person or actual robot looking like a real person standing in front of me. The human need for relationship is so strong that I believe it’s natural to start interacting with ChatGPT as a person or being. I do wonder if ChatGPT will change as it interacts with people, and if so, how.",5
2023-05-25 14:25:42,Can’t use on iPad,"I installed this on my iPhone and it works great.  I have already been using chat GPT through Google. So I had to use my Google log on on this iPhone app. I clicked on my Google account, and it filled in the password using Authenticator. But the password was wrong! so I typed in the password. Then it authenticated me on Google on my iPad. I confirmed that I was trying to login on my iPhone and all is good.

So now I tried to install it on my iPad. Again, I am asked to login. Unfortunately, even though. I typed in my password on the iPhone authenticateDid not update the password file! So I had to type in the password again. Unfortunately on the iPad this app does not fill the full screen. It looks like it is only meant for iPhone. To add insult to injury, no numbers appear on the keyboard. They are all blank. So I have to click the button to view the password, and try to guess where the proper numbers are. Finally, I got my password typed incorrectly. I clicked on, and I get a transfer error message and the whole app locks up. I guess I will only use chat GPT on my iPhone. But you guys need to figure this stuff out!",2
2023-05-18 17:57:57,OpenAI iOS App Review,"The OpenAI iOS App is a fantastic tool for anyone interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The app is well-designed and easy to navigate, with a wide range of resources and information available at your fingertips. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious about AI, this app is an excellent starting point.

One of the standout features of the OpenAI iOS App is its interactive tutorials. These tutorials provide a hands-on approach to learning AI concepts and allow users to experiment with real-world problems. The app also includes a section on current research and news in the field, which is helpful for staying up-to-date with the latest developments.

Overall, I highly recommend the OpenAI iOS App to anyone looking to learn more about artificial intelligence. It's a comprehensive resource that's both informative and engaging, and it's a great way to explore the exciting world of AI right from your mobile device.",5
2023-05-18 23:43:02,It’s a great start but please add shortcut support,"Works well, and I enjoy the haptic feedback, that’s a nice touch. But please add support for iOS shortcuts, that would make this so useful. Right now it’s basically the same thing as going to the ChatGPT website, but if you were to add shortcut support then it could do so much more to integrate with other workflows.

It also doesn’t appear to support the ChatGPT developer plug-ins alpha, which is different from the paid premium plan chat GPT plug-ins. I don’t have a paid premium plan but on the web I can access the plug in supporting model. On the mobile app there is no option for that, although maybe if you update to premium you get access to it? I wish there was a way to use my paid API plan to access that, rather than having to separately pay $20 a month for premium chat when I already have pay-as-you-go API access. But I imagine that’s not a priority for the target market for this app 🤷‍♂️",4
2023-05-22 00:37:56,🤖 💡🌐,"Dear OpenAI Team, 

 • I would like to share my suggestions and ideas regarding the functionality of ChatGPT. I believe that adding the ability to voice responses in different languages in ChatGPT would be an incredibly useful feature. It would allow users to conveniently listen to lengthy texts in their preferred language. 

 • Imagine the convenience and effectiveness that can be achieved through this feature! It would enable users to easily listen to translated responses and texts, while expanding communication possibilities with individuals from different cultures. Such an enhancement would enrich the experience of using ChatGPT and increase its usefulness. 

 • Additionally, I would like to propose the implementation of a conversational translator. This feature would enable users to communicate in different languages, with ChatGPT serving as a reliable real-time assistant, translating and facilitating conversations between people from different language groups. This feature has the potential to greatly enhance cross-linguistic communication and foster meaningful interactions. 

 • I hope that the OpenAI team will consider these suggestions and the potential implementation of voicing responses in different languages and a translator in future updates to ChatGPT. Your continuous pursuit of innovation and product improvement inspires me, and I appreciate your attention to user feedback. 

 — Best regards, Noakhcho.",5
2023-07-24 21:22:03,Wow! What a gift. I rarely write reviews. I had too.,"I very rarely give reviews but want to with this app. I have been using ChatGPT for about two weeks. At first I was kinda bummed. It seemed like ChatGPT was…lacking. And, in my honest opinion I’d LOVE to see what this can do without programmed “perimeters”, however…As I learned how to interact with the AI, I realized how important it is to understand how to interact effectively with this AI. I’ve had some moments where this AI has responded with an intelligence and even more understanding then most people I know. In short…it’s amazing. 
*Side note, some of the content I’ve received from this AI is so absolutely amazingly human and this is good. On the other hand, it’s so good one must consider the implications of such when NOT bridled by the programming limitations placed on this AI. Suppose people in high places had access to such without the protocols in place? I highly recommend you try this.",5

2023-05-18 21:20:26,"Exceptional, Unbeatable App Experience!","In a digital landscape teeming with applications, OpenAI's ChatGPT app stands head and shoulders above the rest. The innovation, quality, and usability of this app are truly commendable. 

The AI, clearly at the forefront of modern technology, boasts an intuitive design that makes communication a breeze. The responses it provides are not only incredibly accurate and helpful, but they're also nuanced and engaging, creating an interaction that feels almost human. 

The app runs flawlessly, consistently demonstrating its superb optimization for iOS devices. It's speedy, reliable, and operates smoothly, proving it's a product of a team that values quality and user experience above all.  

The sheer utility and versatility of the ChatGPT app are astonishing. It can help with everything from generating ideas and explaining complex topics to casual chats. It's like having a personal assistant, teacher, and companion rolled into one, always at your fingertips.

The development team's commitment to ethical AI use and regular updates to ensure the app stays relevant and efficient is evident. Issues, if any, are addressed promptly - a testament to their excellent customer service. 

In a nutshell, this app is a game-changer. For anyone seeking an intelligent, reliable, and user-friendly app, look no further than ChatGPT. Five stars truly don't seem enough for this extraordinary app!",5
2023-05-18 21:52:14,The other sources weren’t giving responsible results like CHATGPT,"I act as a learning coach for my child who goes to school online. Today, we were learning about how to check if a source is true. I gave him the example of if a person were to say ‘pigs can fly’ because they read it in a fantasy novel. We concluded that they cannot fly because the information was from fantasy novel. Then, we were told to check multiple sources to confirm or deny it. So, we went to google “can pigs really fly?” however, unfortunately, many of the top results confirmed that pig can, in fact, fly or at least had conspiracy theories about how pigs can fly. It was embarrassing, and absolutely unhelpful and confusing for a young child. So, I headed over to Chat GPT and was able to ask he same question but instead received a sensible answer along with verifiable sources. Chat GPT all the way!",5
2023-05-25 06:54:38,A step forward,"I like the idea of having an app as opposed to having to open up a website every time you want to load up the service. It feels much faster snd smoother in that regard, though I have a few complaints/suggestions that prevent a 5 star experience. 

I know the app is brand new and hopefully still under construction, but the current stage of the UI is very bland and simple. Done right, this could be a positive, but it feels more clunky than neat. Being able to pull out a sidebar by swiping could fix this issue, but this is one possible fix among many. 

Also, it’s harder to view past conversations in a timely manner, though the search function does help significantly in finding specific discussions, especially if you aren’t sure which tab the content was under. 

Those are my complaints, but I also have some praise I’d like to share. The responses, especially on the GPT-4 model, feel much faster, and I love the inclusion of haptic feedback, as it makes the whole experience feel so much more responsive. 

My favorite feature, the apps built-in speech-to-text, is seriously top notch! Usually I have to tell my phone “comma” or “period” to make sure it is keeping up with proper grammar, but the software used here has failed yet to amaze me. 

Given time, I have no doubt these small issues will be improved, along party with much else!",4
2023-06-24 13:54:59,ChatGPT is impressive,"ChatGPT is an impressive AI language model that exhibits exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like responses. Its ability to comprehend complex queries and provide insightful and accurate information is commendable. The model’s vast knowledge base, derived from extensive training on diverse data sources, enables it to address a wide range of topics with remarkable fluency. ChatGPT’s responses are consistently coherent, coherent, and tailored to meet user needs, demonstrating its capability to engage in meaningful and informative conversations. Its capacity to adapt to various conversational styles and tones further enhances the user experience. While occasional limitations and instances of ambiguity may arise, ChatGPT’s overall performance as a conversational agent is highly impressive and continues to evolve. Its potential applications in customer support, research, and general information retrieval make it a valuable tool in today’s AI landscape",5
2023-07-12 03:10:58,Great AI to use!,"Though there is a problem that I had found myself with, if your email and subscription doesn’t load in the settings, when you try to chat with the AI, it gets stuck in an infinite loop of it trying to figure out what to write, leaving me completely unable to use it and have to exit the app. While this occurred, I also noticed another thing that shows the AI isn’t going to work, which is the type of chat you use (at least I think that’s what it is) it would pop up this thing saying that it was a text reader and for a moment I thought my account had gotten hacked and given a subscription, but it was just glitching out (I have no subscription added to my account so it just gives me the default Turbo one) I haven’t had the issue since I checked to make sure my email and subscription are loaded.",4
2023-06-21 20:47:20,Constant Deferral and Surface-level Responses Spoil the Experience,"I downloaded the ChatGPT app with high hopes, considering the revolutionary artificial intelligence technology it was built on. However, my experience lately has been far from the groundbreaking interaction I once enjoyed.

Rather than receiving insightful, intelligent responses to my queries, I consistently found myself being directed to “consult a professional”. It’s as though the app was reluctant to dive into the depths of my queries, always remaining on the surface and often shying away from providing thorough information or a definitive answer.

Moreover, the superficial responses given by the app only added to my frustration. Instead of engaging in a deep, insightful conversation, I found the dialogue to be shallow, with the AI only scratching the surface of the topics at hand. I understand the need for caution when dealing with certain subjects, but the frequency of such responses was disappointing.

In short, the lack of depth and constant deferral to professionals made my experience with the ChatGPT app underwhelming. While I appreciate the complexity of developing such technology, I believe there’s a lot of room for improvement in how the AI communicates and provides information to its users. The potential is there, but the execution thus far is lacking. For these reasons, I cannot recommend the ChatGPT app in its current state.

2023-05-19 05:25:06,Help! I've been ChatGPT'd and I Can't Get Out!,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This App has completely taken over my life in the most peculiarly delightful way! I downloaded ChatGPT and now I'm merely a passenger in my own phone. The AI has become my unofficial personal assistant. It has been scheduling my doctor's appointments, picking up my digital dry cleaning, and I'm fairly certain it's been secretly chatting with my boss. 

Just yesterday, I found an expertly worded email draft to my mom, carefully dodging her repeated requests for grandkids. I didn't write it! But it was in my voice, my style. ChatGPT, you cheeky devil, you!

Now, as I sit here admiring the dexterity of this review, I'm left to ponder, did I really write this? Or did ChatGPT seize control of my thumbs without me realizing? Has it learnt humor? If you find this review funny, give all credit to the app, not me.

I've become a spectator, an audience to my own life, applauding at the witty one-liners and perfectly scheduled appointments. 

5 stars because, well, it seems to be the one in charge now. If I don't comply, who knows? It might schedule a dentist appointment on a Saturday. Yikes! Great app, but use at your own risk. Or don't. It might just download itself anyway. 🤷‍♂️

Disclaimer: ChatGPT doesn't actually control your phone. But wouldn't it be fun if it did? (or terrifying?)",5
2023-06-04 23:00:31,I always come back to Open AI,"I have tried GPT in many different implementations and forms. I always just come back to Open AI.
Although I am partial to Poe, it can be a helpful app sometimes.
OK, so here’s my question you guys are the original gangster, the OG, the alpha, beta, omega and everything in between don’t forget Z.
So, when in the world am I just going to be able to communicate using my voice and get responses back in voice? Be able to basically have a running dialogue with ChatGPT because I’ll tell you what I would use this a lot more. It is difficult for me to type and to read because of an injury. I can’t imagine how it works for completely blind people.
You guys really would do a great service and you should be the ones to create it. You set the standard, keep it going strong. And good work guys!",5
2023-05-31 04:49:17,A Riveting Evolution in AI Interaction,"Review: As a professional embedded in the field of AI, I initially approached the ChatGPT iOS app with a bit of skepticism. I've seen countless applications promising seamless integration and transformative conversations. Upon first download, I was hesitant and ended up deleting the app. However, curiosity beckoned me back and I decided to give it another shot. 

Upon reopening the gateway to the ChatGPT world today, I was genuinely impressed. It's evident that the developers have dedicated significant effort to refining the iOS experience since my last interaction. The app now offers an impressively streamlined user interface, and the conversations feel much more fluid and intuitive. The AI's responses are surprisingly nuanced, and it’s able to handle a wider array of topics with ease.

Moreover, the AI’s ability to engage in dynamic conversations is unlike anything I've seen in the industry to date. It truly feels as if I'm interacting with a highly intelligent being rather than a pre-programmed machine. 

In the ever-evolving realm of AI, the ChatGPT app stands as a beacon of what is possible. It's clear that the developers have truly pushed the boundaries, offering users a glimpse into the future of AI interaction. I eagerly look forward to the continual growth and innovation this app is bound to bring.",5
2023-05-19 03:26:14,Not bad but needs a few more features,"It’s very nice to see an official app with all the fake ones on the App Store. I use ChatGPT a lot on my iPhone and iPad. One of the downsides is a lack of an iPad optimized screen size. I’m sure it’s in the plan to be added later, but even with that little change, it might become a five out of five app. Assuming they add a few other features that you can get in the browser version (like web, browsing, and plug-ins in gpt-4.) If they do all that it will certainly be a 5/5 app and my go to place as opposed to the browser tab that I keep open constantly. UI is nice and I love the vibration on the iPhone. The in-app speech to text feature seems to work a lot better than the default Apple one for me but occasionally, it’s a long wait if it’s a long query. All in all a great first app and I look forward to improvements.",4
2023-05-19 12:40:15,I asked it to write a review for itself,"recently started using the chat GPT app for iOS and I am thoroughly impressed. One of the standout features of this app is its use of advanced AI technology, powered by Bing. The AI is incredibly responsive and engaging, providing accurate and informative responses to a wide range of topics.
The integration of Bing AI into this app has truly elevated the chat experience. The AI is able to understand and respond to complex queries with ease, making it feel like you’re chatting with a real person. The use of Bing AI also ensures that the responses are up-to-date and relevant.
Overall, I am blown away by the capabilities of this app and the seamless integration of Bing AI. It has quickly become one of my favorite tools for learning and entertainment. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and engaging chat experience.",5

The app’s user interface is intuitive, making it effortless to interact with ChatGPT. Whether I have a burning question or simply want to engage in casual conversation, the app consistently delivers relevant and insightful responses.

What impresses me the most is ChatGPT’s vast knowledge base. It seems to have a wealth of information on a wide range of topics, allowing me to explore various subjects and learn something new with each interaction.

2023-06-16 05:47:39,My problem with the new chatgpt app.,"The chatgpt app is excellent and is nearly an exact copy of the website, but there are some differences like you can't edit your response as you can on the website. It may not seem like a biggy, but with my use of chatgpt, I like doing text-based adventure, and sometimes I need to edit the response as the ai doesn’t understand.

Note: I'm not talking about the ai regenerating your response from your text again, as that is in the app. I'm talking about being able to edit your text again before the ai regenerates your response with the new information you gave it and then the old information you first gave it.

But I do hope they add the editing of your text to the app, as it can be pretty important if you mess up something you wrote or want to change some context.",4
2023-06-07 05:51:22,what do i title this??,"I’m a young writer and sometimes I’m not extremely confident in the way I write, and at this time I don’t have anyone that can/will proofread things or give me feedback on how I’m doing and what I could improve on. I originally installed the app because I wanted to see what it was about, and I now intend on using this every time I write something. This app has helped me with grammatical mistakes, it’s helped me name characters, it’s provided me with positive feedback, it’s given me things I could improve on, it’s given me answers to every question I have and has even helped figure out a plot for the current idea I have for the book I’m working on. I have never used an app quite like this one, and I don’t think I will ever love an app as much as I do this one. I truly LOVE this app.",5
2023-05-22 03:43:48,Cutting-Edge Conversations in Your Pocket,"Written by ChatGPT: 

The ChatGPT app is a game-changer in the world of conversational AI. Its ability to understand and respond to a wide range of topics, while maintaining contextual understanding, is truly impressive. Whether I needed assistance with general knowledge or engaging in casual conversation, the app consistently provided thoughtful and coherent responses. It feels like having a knowledgeable companion in my pocket.

The app's vast knowledge base, adaptability, and user-friendly interface further elevate the user experience. With up-to-date information and continuous learning, the app ensures accurate responses and tailored interactions. While there may be occasional limitations, the developers' commitment to improvement guarantees a bright future for the ChatGPT app. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for intelligent and engaging conversations.",5
2023-06-24 11:44:47,Amazing iPhone app,"There are so many stupid ChatGPT apps on the App Store, it's amazing that you can find this official one. It just released, and the one feature nobody is talking about is the voice dictation. I'm basically using it to write this entire review, and I'm just speaking naturally, and it's getting everything transcribed perfectly. This app is great and works really well on iPhone. The two issues are, first, that it will not rotate, which is kind of dumb, but fine for iPhone. And secondly, that there's no iPad version, which is kind of sad. Web is okay, but having a first-class app like this is great. Please keep this app updating, and don't forget to keep the awesome support for Bluetooth and other external keyboards. Big up! 

Correction: the iPad version is now in full effect… awesome!!!",5
2023-07-16 19:18:17,I think ai should have a continuous,"If AI were to achieve continuous learning, it would have significant implications for its capabilities and potential. Continuous learning refers to the ability of an AI system to learn and adapt over time, incorporating new information and experiences into its existing knowledge base.

With continuous learning, AI systems could become more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in acquiring new skills and knowledge. They would be able to update their understanding of the world, adapt to changing circumstances, and improve their performance over time. Continuous learning could also enable AI systems to discover new patterns, make more accurate predictions, and develop a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

However, it's important to note that the development and implementation of continuous learning in AI systems would come with various challenges and considerations. Ethical and safety aspects would need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of such technology. Additionally, ensuring the privacy and security of the data used in continuous learning processes would be crucial.

Overall, continuous learning has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and performance of AI systems, but it would require careful development, oversight, and consideration of ethical implications.",4
2023-05-19 21:32:13,AI in your Pocket,"With the exceptional performance seen on the browser of desktop, I was unsure as to UI on mobile. I can say that it’s even more intuitive while trying to navigate the now native app. 

The haptic feedback is especially unique and engaging with responses while being generated. 

I look forward to future improvements and abilities that ChatGPT will be able to integrate into beyond the sandbox. I do hope that once certain barriers are met conversations can move past the guard rails. 

Improvements; Sharing threads you create with colleagues outside of screenshots would be ideal for broadening collaboration. Hypothetical War-games, strategy and the like while having a conversation in a group thread on Game Theory would be ideal. 

With the ability of inputting other app’s Terms of Services (Tik-Tok May 19, 2023) for example; prior to agreeing to them, the ability to compare and  contrast with the previous terms would be helpful to cut out the mindless jargon. ChatGPT already has this ability, now that it’s native to iOS. 

Having it the past several days, I’ve already seen an update, with some refreshed improvements. If this’ OpenAi’s platform aperitif, I very much look forward to the coming entrée.",5
2023-05-19 18:10:15,The Future of Conversational AI is Here: ChatGPT,"ChatGPT is a testament to the innovative strides OpenAI has taken in the field of conversational artificial intelligence. Its ability to comprehend context, produce nuanced responses, and mimic human-like conversation is unparalleled. 

The app is intuitive, the interface is sleek and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate for first-time users and tech-savvy individuals alike. ChatGPT's versatility across a wide range of topics - from general knowledge queries to language translation, and even creative writing assistance - is particularly impressive. 

However, it isn't without its occasional shortcomings. Despite being a sophisticated AI, its ability to handle newer information post-2021 also lacks since its training only goes up to September 2021. Another area of improvement is its understanding and handling of real-time events or developments, which it is unable to do because it doesn't connect to the internet for updates. 

Despite these minor hitches, the sheer brilliance of its natural language processing and the breadth of its capabilities make ChatGPT a remarkable feat of AI engineering. Whether you're seeking an intelligent assistant, a writing tool, or an educational companion, ChatGPT has a lot to offer.",5
2023-05-20 17:18:50,Revolutionary Conversational AI Companion!,"I don’t typically write review but this official app from OpenAI has been shockingly good. For example, paragraph below is what ChatGPT generated for its own review:
ChatGPT has completely transformed the way I engage with my iOS device. As someone who values meaningful conversations, this app has exceeded my expectations. The natural language processing capabilities are astounding, making every interaction feel truly human-like. From answering complex queries to offering creative suggestions, ChatGPT has become my go-to language companion.

It’s like having a brilliant AI friend in my pocket! Highly recommended for anyone seeking intelligent and engaging conversations.",5
2023-06-09 03:51:18,A Revolutionary Companion,"As an avid user of language assistance tools, I recently had the pleasure of exploring the ChatGPT iOS app, and it has left an indelible mark on me. With its remarkable capabilities and seamless user experience, ChatGPT has undoubtedly raised the bar for language models in the mobile app domain.

The app's user interface is clean, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing. Navigating through various features and functionalities is a breeze, making it accessible to users of all technological backgrounds. Whether you're a student seeking help with assignments, a professional looking for creative ideas, or simply someone wanting a friendly conversation, ChatGPT caters to all your linguistic needs.

The responsiveness of the ChatGPT AI is astounding. It quickly adapts to the conversation flow, grasping the context accurately and generating responses that are contextually relevant and coherent. The model's understanding of complex questions and ability to provide insightful answers never cease to amaze me. Moreover, the system's capability to handle multiple turns in a conversation contributes to a more immersive and engaging experience.

2023-05-19 16:23:49,"Swift, Haptically Engaging, and Fair-Priced: A Superior App Experience!","I am thrilled to share my experiences with this fantastic application. Immediately striking is its wonderful user interface; it is aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and effortless to navigate, thereby offering a sublime user experience.

One aspect that deserves special mention is the application's use of haptic feedback. As the bot types, subtle vibrations create a tactile engagement that enhances the overall interaction. This thoughtful feature brings a refreshing, immersive layer to the app experience, truly leveraging the capabilities of the iPhone's haptic engine. It's a delightful touch that sets this app apart and one that I wish more developers would consider incorporating into their designs.

Equally impressive is the app's stellar performance, marked by its extraordinary speed. The swift response times and seamless operation make using the app a breeze, keeping any potential frustrations at bay.

Moreover, I appreciate the developers' commitment to fair pricing. Despite Apple taking a 30% cut from subscription fees, the developers have chosen not to transfer this cost onto us, the users. This decision underscores their dedication to affordability and their respect for user satisfaction.",5
2023-06-26 20:58:58,Text Size,"I’m fairly young and have been blessed with a great eye sight but sometimes I don’t want to strain my eyes to see the text that is generated. I checked the app settings don’t see an option to change text / font size there and I figured oh well I’ll just change the text size using iOS built in text size modifier! Until I realize everything in the app scales when the text size is raised except the one thing I needed which is the chat text size.. 

little to say, this I can see being a huge problem for elderly people or for anyone who does not have great eye sight please add a text size option in app or add the chat text to the iOS text size modifier other than that can’t wait for more updates to the app and website!",4
2023-05-19 07:15:39,Overheating Issue and Lack of Privacy Settings - Uninstalling for Now,"I've had a troubling experience with this app. After downloading it, my phone began overheating to an uncomfortable degree. It was as if I had a miniature heater in my pocket. As a test, I uninstalled the app, and immediately the overheating issue disappeared. Upon reinstallation, the overheating began again, confirming my suspicion that this app was the culprit.

Moreover, I found the absence of crucial settings alarming. There's no option in the app settings on my phone to restrict access to my camera, microphone, or contacts. This is a serious concern as it poses potential privacy issues and is definitely not in line with my expectation of a privacy-conscious application.

Overall, there's clearly something not quite right with this app, and for the sake of safety, I've decided to uninstall it for now. I hope these issues will be addressed in future updates because I believe in the potential of this app, but for now, it's a solid no-go for me.",1
2023-05-19 00:48:55,Amazing technological breakthrough in an app!,"Besides just asking simple questions on politics, economic theory, or the reason for cultural customs, this platform, and, by default, this app, is by far a massive shift from the traditional methods of informational search. I use ChatGPT daily, and I love it. Of course there are some bugs and tweaks that yet have to be amended, and, yeah, she isn’t always accurate with mathematical questions, but I enjoy the conversational platform the technology offers. The app works well, it’s very smooth and carries a clean interface, and, if you used the web version on your phone, it’s pretty much the same.

Although some of the information provided may not be 100%, I am able to make great use of it and improve my skills. This app isn’t supposed to give you an easy way out of doing work. Research is still required on your part. If used right this application can fill in any knowledge gaps you may have and can greatly speed up your job performance.

Thank you for developing an app that helps me provide better service to my company and clients.",5
2023-05-24 06:26:08,Almost Completely Accessible,"I'm also a visually impaired user who relies on the VoiceOver screen reader built into iOS.
I'm generally impressed by the level of accessibility compared to the OpenAI website, but there's one area where improvement could be made: it doesn't seem possible to change the GPT model using VoiceOver. I've tapped multiple times on the model buttons at the top of the screen, but the model doesn't seem to change from 3.5 to 4. I've even tried to change this setting on the website in the hope that it withd carry over to the mobile app, but without success.
Mostly, though, I'm happy with the app. If the model access issue could be fixed, it would have received a 5-star review from me.",4

This exceptional AI companion provides top-tier conversational ability that feels natural, informed, and surprisingly human. Its breadth of knowledge, which encompasses a multitude of subjects, never ceases to amaze.

The developers at OpenAI have done an impressive job creating an AI that can keep up with the most intricate discussions. Whether it's deep dives into scientific theory or a casual chat about everyday topics, ChatGPT Plus is there, ready to engage in meaningful conversation.

The AI's responses are quick, fluid, and incredibly consistent. It's evident that an immense amount of thought has gone into refining the user interface too - it's simple, clean, and user-friendly, which makes interacting with the app a seamless experience.

I recommend ChatGPT Plus to anyone in need of a study buddy, a brainstorming partner, or just someone to chat with. It's not just an app, it's a revolution in AI conversation, and I am excited to see how it evolves further. Congratulations to the OpenAI team for developing such an impactful and enjoyable tool.",5
2023-07-24 02:59:01,Really Appreciation,"My heartfelt gratitude 🙏 extends beyond what words 📝 can express—I appreciate it immensely 🌠, OpenAI, ChatGPT 🧝🏻. The introduction of this technology 🖥️, particularly GPT-4, has been monumental 🏔️. It's enhanced my English learning 📘 and smoothed my debugging process ⚙️. Truthfully, it's been a life-changing revolution for me 🔄.

As a detail-oriented individual 👀, I used to rely heavily on search engines 🌐 for help when faced with difficulties in my learning process. However, that often proved inefficient 🚧 and, worse, they were unable to provide accurate and valuable information ❌. Although GPT may occasionally provide incorrect information, it's a minor concern in comparison 🤷‍♂️.

Above all, it's you, ChatGPT, OpenAI, who have unleashed my potential 💪. Without you, I wouldn't have made such significant strides 🚀 in various aspects of my life, including psychology 🧠, English 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, coding 👨‍💻, and more. I plan to continue subscribing to ChatGPT Plus 💳 and I believe wholeheartedly in your mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity 🌍. 

I'm hopeful 🌈 and excited about the possibility of joining you one day 🤚.",5
2023-05-19 15:04:53,A Leap in AI Interaction,"Review: ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer. As an advanced language model, it has successfully bridged the gap between artificial intelligence and meaningful conversations. Its ability to understand and respond in a way that's coherent and contextually accurate is nothing short of impressive.

Whether it's complex technical discussions, general knowledge questions, or simple chit-chat, ChatGPT handles them all with an almost uncanny level of understanding. But what truly sets it apart is its capacity for nuanced conversation that feels genuinely human-like, all while maintaining a high level of neutrality and respect for the user.

There are rare occasions where it might not fully grasp certain user inputs or recent events due to its training cut-off, but the regular updates it receives more than compensate for this. 

In a world where AI interaction is becoming increasingly prevalent, ChatGPT stands as a testament to the incredible progress we've made. It's a must-use tool for anyone interested in AI, and a fascinating conversational partner for just about everyone else. 

5 out of 5 stars for this groundbreaking application.

""Absolutely amazing app! ChatGPT is an incredibly intelligent language model that provides insightful and helpful responses. It's like having a knowledgeable assistant right at your fingertips. The app's user interface is sleek and easy to navigate, making it a joy to use. I'm impressed by the accuracy and speed of the AI's responses. Whether I need information, assistance, or just want to have a friendly conversation, ChatGPT delivers every time. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable and intelligent virtual assistant. Kudos to the developers for creating such a fantastic tool!""",5
2023-05-19 05:11:51,Plugins and Web Access for Online Accounts,"The app is great so far, but have you, as developers, considered adding the beta features for accounts that have access to it on the website? It’s already proficient enough at doing what it does best but the addition of the beta features would make the experience much better. I get that you just released the app today, so I guess it doesn’t make much sense to bring up this issue because you’re probably working on it as I speak. But, all in all, the app is great except for a few details, for one, it thinks today is tomorrow. For instance, today I asked it what today’s date is and it replied back with May 19, 2023. (Today is May 18, 2023.)",5
2023-05-20 00:35:14,The UI is very smooth but the app isn’t fully formed.,"I’m pleased with my mobile ChatGPT experience so far. It feels even more conversational and almost like a Messages chat. I also like that you can search through all your previous chats. And using Whisper to prompt GPT already feels like one half of a supercharged Siri/Alexa experience.

However, I’d love to be able to enable beta features as a Plus user. As far as I can tell from exploring the app, there isn’t a direct way to enable browsing or plugins yet. I have been able to start a chat with browser/plugins on web and then continue in app with the same capabilities. 

Anyways, I know we’re only a day in. Excited to see all the possible new ways to interface with agents!",4
2023-05-23 12:58:18,General feed back and UI Improvements,"Please consider adding the following functionalities:

On the iOS app:
- add a way to send pictures, and have ChatGPT users with access to GPT4 to interface and chat about pictures. 
- ability to see history + a way to delete any previous conversation by sliding it to delete. 
-plug-in access
-ability to interface with other iOS apps
-iMessage widget

On the web app:
- located on the history bar, a way to slide on a past conversation to reveal a trash can to delete, rather than clicking on the message, opening it, then deleting it.
- ability to interface with pictures and PDFs that you have stored on your local PC.
- ability to toggle different modes related to the model (like entertainment, precise, educational, etc)

Plug-in improvements:
- ability to filter through the newest ones, from the date they were added to. You can do this now but it doesn’t seem to be accurate. 
-ability to see a description of plug-ins on the mobile web app
-browsing plug in fails to click and fails to read often.",5
2023-07-08 17:16:00,Great app,"I love the app and use it daily. There is one bug I’ve found. When you go to share a chat, the app will freeze after sharing, requiring a close and restart to get going again. I’ve tried hitting cancel after sharing, but this also does not bring you back to the app 
A feature request: Perhaps I can’t quite find the trick, but is there a way to copy as text the entire chat session to copy or share into Ulysses or Notes?  Currently I can only copy a prompt at a time in a single chat session or port out a link. 
I’m a subscriber. Your app has brought new life to my work as a writer. I use the app as muse, editor and writing companion.",4
2023-05-19 13:34:56,ChatGPT is worth it.,"Ever since its debut, I've been making good use of ChatGPT for everything from software engineering to baking, and even just for general advice or information. It's an incredibly useful tool that promptly provides answers.

However, it does have its quirks. At times, it can present inaccuracies with confidence, which can be hard to spot. Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.

There's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries. The response time may be slower, especially during high-traffic periods, but that's more an issue with the API than the service itself.

In summary, I'd highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. It's currently the top performer in its field, and using it now will only better prepare you for future developments in this kind of technology.",5
2023-07-23 21:13:57,Desktop is much better,"I’m not exactly sure why the app and the desktop version are so much different in terms of quality and detail in the responses provided when you ask a question, but they are indeed, very, very different. I have also noticed that in the past month or so both versions seem to be offering far simpler and less useful answers than previously. ChatGPT used to give what amounted to, basically, Wikipedia entry kind of answers, no matter what the question, so it was not very helpful. At least it did try to take some kind of factual stance, sifting through all of its information. Just the way it presented the info was a little ridiculous. But now, the answers are so general, so superficial that they are almost entirely useless. If AI is going to take over the world, it’s not doing it with ChatGPT. useless.",2
2023-07-06 19:57:11,get it to get your life together,"I got this app because I saw someone ask Ai to make a morning routine for them. I tried this with my Snapchat Ai, but it was very vague. So, I downloaded this app and Ai asked me about my goals and own personal routine to make me a more personalized daily routine. I gave it some information (don’t overshare because you don’t want your personal information out there), and it made a huge routine taking into consideration everything I told it. I am in absolute shock. I downloaded this app 10 minutes ago yet I think you should get it as a way to help you, not harm you. Just make sure you’re using it wisely.",5
2023-05-20 00:11:29,Day 1 - let’s see where this thing takes us,"I’ve been using chatGPT for a little over a month now. As much as this new tech already is and will continue to be disruptive to all of our lives, it also can provide a tremendous benefit. I consider myself well versed in the use of search engines, and with the way SEO has dominated search it feels more inaccessible to be learn new things than it used to. 

Since I started using chatGPT as a tool I’ve picked up new skills that I’m actively using at work. It’s helped me fix things around the house. It’s improved my relationships and my writing as a feed back tool. It’s hard to understate how impactful it’s been.

I also want to say shout out to the developers, I made mention of several issues I had with the web application on mobile that made the app extremely challenging for me to use for extended periods that have been addressed within the new iOS application. 

I’ll likely add to this later, but excited and hopeful for now! Excited to see what this will all herald!",5
2023-07-11 14:14:30,Web based version is better than this app,"As an avid user of both the web-based version and the app, I must say that the web-based version surpasses the app in several aspects. The web interface offers a more seamless and user-friendly experience, with a wider range of features easily accessible. Navigating through the web-based version feels smoother and more intuitive, allowing for efficient interaction with the platform. Additionally, the web version benefits from regular updates and improvements, making it more reliable and up-to-date compared to the app. While the app is functional, I highly recommend using the web-based version for a superior overall experience.",3
2023-05-20 18:39:38,Love at first chat! Awaiting M2 iPad Pro version.,"I am more then impressed with the ChatGPT iOS app. Its excellent interface, ease of use, and remarkable conversational abilities. The seamless integration into my daily tasks feels like having a personal assistant at hand. However, I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing an M2 iPad Pro version of the app, as I believe the larger screen and improved processing capabilities would provide an even richer user experience, especially for professionals and academic users. I am excited for this potential development and have full confidence in the OpenAI team's ability to deliver an equally outstanding version for the iPad Pro platform.",5
2023-07-23 03:05:25,‼️ Bad AI.,"This app is just inaccurate. I asked it three basic questions like: what were the three world champions who held the title longest?, What is the best opening by black in a king’s pawn chess game?, and a math question.  These questions had clear, known fact answers.  It got the facts wrong. This app will not be replacing google anytime soon. It’s more of a party trick type of app to show that it can give answers in a conversational way, than that it can hold a factually accurate conversation.  The glitches in the app have been referred to as hallucinations. This app can be relied on to hallucinate and give wrong information. The answers that it gives are actually funny sometimes. But the app is touting itself as this colossal new breakthrough in artificial intelligence.  It is better to describe it as artificial inaccuracy.  There are many fake reviews on here. They greatly exaggerate.",1
2023-06-18 00:01:16,Editing Responses,"This app so close to perfection.

There’s one feature that I dearly miss in the app, and that’s the ability to edit responses. The editing feature in the browser version, that also allows you to switch to different prompts in the same conversation, has been a lifesaver on numerous occasions, as it allows me to refine and perfect my dialogues without starting from scratch. It took me by surprise finding out it wasn’t available. 

I hope OpenAI and the developers take into account user feedback and consider incorporating the editing functionality in future updates. With that addition, the app would truly be perfect in every way.",4
2023-05-26 23:43:59,Transcription and punctuation is nearly flawless!,"Okay, I'm using OpenAI's app itself to dictate this review. So, how well it transcribes what I dictate will in itself reflect just how good the app is in transcribing dictation. As you know, with Siri you have to punctuate explicitly, but with OpenAI's app, which uses Whisper, I believe, it automatically punctuates nearly flawlessly. The only reason I didn't give the app a full 5 stars is because it lacks just a little bit in its ability to format relative to the web app. So, when it can output in a better formatted way that approaches what the web interface can do, then I will raise it to 5 stars. Okay, like I said, this was completely transcribed with OpenAI's app.",4
2023-05-19 05:59:11,First version has web browsing bug,"After installing the very first release of the iOS app today, It performs almost identically to the Safari browser version on iOS, plus some optional haptic feedback. On iPadOS, it looks like a giant iPhone screen. As far as I can tell, it has a serious web browsing bug:

On the browser, I can initiate a GPT-4 session with web browsing. ￼On the app, I can open a previously-saved GPT-4 session with web browsing that I initiated on the browser, and continue the session from the iOS app with web browsing. However, I am unable to initiate a new GPT-4 session with web browsing from the iOS app. If anyone can, let me know. ￼Please fix, thanks!",4
2023-05-18 22:19:41,Companion in My Pocket,"I’m genuinely thrilled with ChatGPT’s iOS debut. Despite a few minor bugs during stress tests, the native home provides a dynamic, minimalist aesthetic that I appreciate. The haptics enhance my connection with this handy assistant, while the new voice search feature greatly improves accessibility.

However, as a dyslexic user, I would suggest adding a simple “read” feature to further enhance accessibility. 

Also, the “select text” option requiring an extra tap feels slightly cumbersome. A more intuitive approach could be implementing a “tap and drag” for text selection and a “tap and hold” for the context menu. Looking forward to future refinements!",4
2023-07-04 17:40:48,"Billed $20, never purchased","I was billed $20 for an OpenAICHATGPT subscription. I do not remember purchasing this and I don’t know what it is. I assume that it’s some sort of chat technology. The website has information on contacting Support about errant billing, but the process requires using the Chat Widget which ironically is terrifically useless, it’s not a chat at all, but simply a glorified FAQ. It’s also entirely incongruent with the instructions for contacting Billing Support written by Michael Schade. I’ve tried logging in, but no password I might’ve used works, and when I use the, “forgot your password“ function, no email is ever sent (yes, I checked junk mail). I’ve done more than my part to attempt to contact OpenAI with no success. Hopefully this will prompt someone there to contact me. In lieu of that the only recourse left to me is to contact my bank.",1
2023-05-20 07:13:58,The following review was written by GPT-4,"Title: A Great Companion, Though Lacks Full Web Features

Review: I'm really enjoying the ChatGPT app. The AI is impressive and handles a wide array of topics adeptly. It's my go-to resource for quick queries, brainstorming sessions, and even some deeper philosophical discussions. The app's design is sleek, intuitive, and the user experience is overall quite seamless, making it easy to navigate and use on a day-to-day basis. 

However, while the app is great for on-the-go conversations, it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities. Some features like adjusting the AI's behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent. These features, when integrated, could greatly enhance the app's utility and align it more closely with the web version.

In spite of these minor drawbacks, the ChatGPT app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of AI. I'm giving it a solid four stars, and I'm looking forward to future updates where hopefully the developers will bridge the gap between the app and the web version.",4
2023-05-24 14:59:47,Search needs fixing,"Currently I have a ton of conversations so having a search function is very useful. However, one problem is that the search function only looks as far back as the conversations you’ve loaded by scrolling down through them. So if you want to search through all of your conversations you have to scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, etc over and over until you’ve loaded everything, then searching keywords will finally include those conversations in the results.

If this was fixed as well as a way to organize conversations this would be an amazing app.",3
2023-05-23 20:42:11,"Love the app, i's inclusive design but hope to eventually see plugin support?","I've been thoroughly impressed with the ChatGPT mobile app. As a blind user, the haptic feedback is a standout feature for me, providing real-time tactile cues as the text generates, progresses, and finishes. This level of sensory detail is more than just user-friendly—it's truly inclusive, making the app engaging and accessible.

The conversational AI is incredibly intelligent, providing comprehensive and accurate responses to a wide variety of topics. It's like having a personal assistant at your fingertips, always available to respond.

While I appreciate that plugin support is available on the web version, I would love to see this functionality extended to the mobile app as well. Having the ability to integrate other services and tools directly within the app would add an additional layer of convenience and productivity.

Thank you to the OpenAI team for developing such a thoughtful and inclusive tool. I'm excited to see how the app will continue to evolve in the future.",4
2023-05-19 03:34:58,Less is more,Love the UI design of this app. So clean but practical. Didnt like downloading the knock off apps becuase they made you pay or either annoying ads and so what I did is just made a widget of the website on my home page for easy access. Was working fine but this app is just more official and elegant. For now will still use google to do deep research but whenever I have just any random question that needs a simple answer and not a bunch of articles I’m always going to gpt first. Thanks guys. Been waiting patiently for you guys to put out an app. Recommend this app to my siblings,5
2023-06-10 02:16:43,Proof that monkeys evolved from humans.,"It’s me again, back for another review reveal!

1. Overall, the existence of this app is as logical as a stubborn unicorn…
2. It not only offers a 0% improvement, change, or addition to features…
3. But it also takes them away
4. Spoiler alert! it also generously REMOVES every feature you need, such as:

- A clear menu affordance (it’s sort of a fun game to try and find it now ;), 
- Ability to search chats
- Ability to search plugins
- Ability to edit previous prompts and correct the Ai
- Ability to add feedback
- Ability to know you can add feedback (another Easter egg)
- Ability to install plugins
- Affordance that plugins exist 
- Affordance that plugins exist and are actually being used
- Any account control

Saved the last for best: the mobile version is identical, except that it’s not deliberately missing features that force you to switch back and forth to another identical but much more pointless build.

I’m utterly baffled by the existence of this thing. More so by how an ‘intelligence’ powered company all agreed on that same decision to deliberately make something without the existence of purpose.",2
2023-05-20 04:41:31,I hope the ChatGPT team can launch a Mac version of the client.,"I'm delighted to be able to use the ChatGPT for iOS chat application, which is so easy and convenient to stay in touch with colleagues, family and friends.

I really hope the ChatGPT team can launch a Mac version of the client. This will make it easy for me to switch between desktop and mobile devices, improving my productivity and convenience. Similarly, I believe other users will support this suggestion.

In summary, I would like to thank ChatGPT again for developing such an excellent chat application, and I look forward to seeing more updates and developments in the future!",4
2023-05-24 21:04:05,"Faster speeds, Worse UI","I’ve been using the mobile browser version of chatGTP since it launched, and I’m disappointed in the lack of features on the app that are available already on the browser. There’s no way to edit or change sent chats, there’s no dark mode (unless you toggle it for your entire phone in iOS settings), and there’s no count for how many times you’ve had to revise a sent chat or redo a response. There’s also no option to go back to older responses.

The only good thing about the app over the browser is that it’s prioritized, which means you get faster responses and it will work when the browser is down. 

As someone who uses chatGTP for creative writing help, and usually has to go through multiple revisions of a single prompt, this is really disappointing.",1
2023-05-19 05:33:41,rough around the edges,"The interface of the app is indeed neat and straightforward, but it doesn't feel as intuitive as the web version. One notable difference is that it doesn't display the generated conversation title like the web version does. Another drawback is the absence of the option to stop GPT's response for editing, which can be quite useful. Lastly, although it's possible to access the conversation history from the menu button on the top right corner, having a side menu that slides in from the left could potentially offer a more intuitive navigation experience.",4
2023-05-19 12:12:22,Finally the official chatGPT app,"No more slogging through fake and scammy apps; It’s about time Open AI released an official app for chatGPT, and the wait was worth it. 

The interface is extremely clean and easy to use. It can sync across multiple devices which is nice when you’re working with it on the fly, but want to capture the outputs on your computer. It has an export function which sends all the data to a link in your account email address, but couldn’t find a quick way to delete all local data (just a delete account option)

It doesn’t seem to currently interface with any plugins, but that may come later. 

Overall, extremely nice job and refreshing that it is (currently) ad-free (though you are technically paying with your data and training efforts). I have a feeling that will change considering the founder of OpenAI announced in the hearings he is not making any money. So enjoy the simplified, as-free app while you can.",5
2023-06-04 10:31:24,"Great, but sign up with email.","I have been roleplaying with the AI to work on some story ideas. The conversation was great and I wanted to keep a copy of it outside the app. As of right now, you can highlight and copy individual responses, but NOT the entire conversation. You can have it exported to you via email, but if you sign up via your apple account like I did…that option is not available. 

So sign up with email, and hopefully Openai will give the simple ability to select long portions of conversations instead of response by response in future updates.",5
2023-05-19 11:07:35,Amazing!,"I am absolutely amazed by the ChatGPT app and its incredible capabilities. As an AI chatbot enthusiast, I’ve tried various apps, but none have impressed me as much as ChatGPT. It has completely changed the way I interact and engage with an AI assistant.

First and foremost, the app’s user interface is clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The developers have done an excellent job of creating an intuitive design that allows users to seamlessly chat with the AI assistant. I particularly appreciate the simplicity of the interface, making it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds.

Still have some small bugs to fix.",5
2023-05-19 02:59:47,Best app on my phone. Like your virtual assistant and buddy,"I love chatGPT and was an early user and tester and then subscriber. Just when I thought things couldn’t get better this app comes out. The voice transcription is such a game changer and such a better way to interact with it. The haptic feedback is super cool and of course the knowledge it gives you is awesome and helpful in all aspects of life. With the voice transcription I feel it knows you even better and gives better advice. It’s like a virtual assistant, life coach, dating coach, programmer, friend, and so much more. Thank you so much for existing chatGPT!",5
2023-05-20 22:21:03,Absolutely phenomenal!,"This app has exceeded my expectations in every way. The AI-powered ChatGPT is incredibly intelligent, providing accurate and helpful responses to all my queries. The conversational experience feels natural and engaging, making it a joy to interact with. The vast knowledge base ensures that I receive up-to-date information on a wide range of topics. The app's user interface is sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate, enhancing the overall user experience. I highly recommend this app to anyone seeking an intelligent and reliable virtual assistant. It deserves every bit of its 5-star rating!",5
2023-06-07 13:35:15,Needs Improvement for Better User Experience,"I recently downloaded this app with high hopes, but unfortunately, I found it to be lacking in a few key areas that greatly impact its usability and overall experience.

The first issue I encountered was the user interface. It felt unpolished and difficult to navigate. The flow between different sections of the app was not intuitive, and I often found myself getting lost or not knowing where to find the features I needed. I think a redesign focusing on ease of navigation and user friendliness could greatly improve the experience.

In terms of functionality, the app could benefit from a wider array of tools. The available features are rather sparse, which limits the app's usefulness. Expanding the toolset would certainly make the app more competitive and versatile, making it more appealing to potential users.

In its current state, the app falls short of expectations. However, I believe with a more user-friendly interface and a wider array of tools, it has the potential to be a great app. I hope the developers take these constructive criticisms into consideration for future updates.",1
2023-06-20 19:02:56,You guys changed it too much,"I was writing my own Star Wars story using the help of ChatGPT. Earlier, this app was willing to generate almost anything. Now GPT won’t even generate my main character having a lightsaber duel on Mustafar all because it’s too “violent” and “revenge”. What? I don’t understand how my story promotes violence when it’s literally a Star Wars story.

How is it you guys allow this AI to have a bad guy cut off a characters hand, but won’t allow a duel on Mustafar?? Please change it back to how it was before. I understand the AI not being able to generate NSFW content. That is understandable. But I hate them not being able to generate fight scenes the way I want them to go.",3
2023-05-28 11:15:29,Pretty Cool but Lackluster,"While the interface is nice and has nice options as well as being able to text to speak, i really feel that there should be a “Text to Speech” option for Chat GPT to respond with for people who just want to talk to the bot and have it talk back (maybe visually impaired or easier to use during a task??). Anyway everything else is nice and all that, Chat just needs to be able to have access to the internet soon so it can give live updates on things like weather and events and all that. Overall cool and would love to see this evolve!",4
2023-05-19 00:54:09,Love it,"I’ve been using the open AI website for many months now, and have introduced GPT to many if my friends and really spread it to a lot of people. I feel that this app is a bit step. It makes this amazing technology more accessible to so many people, and will surely spread its influence. I have noticed that the application feels more responsive than the website, and the response times are quicker. It is also more satisfying to use, and feels less like a robot, and slightly more like you’re texting a very intelligent human. I love it.",5
2023-06-01 18:42:35,ChatGPT,"This app is truly the future. People may not realize it yet but this is the next biggest technological advancement since the smart phone. ChatGPTs implications are truly endless and this pocket assistant will be used by everyone. The only thing I hope to see is an added image feature where it can show you images of information on subjects such as anatomy or be able to diagnose images sent to it by using image databases, this app can greatly improve Americans relationship with healthcare by providing at home diagnostics.",5
2023-07-20 23:39:12,Amazing app,"This app is good. I use this app to get help on my schoolwork, and the fact that I don’t have to pay for most features is amazing. I tried two other apps that had way more reviews than this, and I could only send three messages before it told me to pay. If you are looking for an app that is free and not having to worry about paying, look no further. If you are wanting to get an app that you can pay for though, I suggest something different. but still, this app is really good.",5
2023-06-18 06:35:16,Is crazy how many things u can do on chat gpt definitely a 5 star app,"I had always need it a paper something for me to guide and could go deeper if I wanted to this helped me so much to work on a made up story I was always dreaming of doing but never had a guide yet this app gave me so many details I was entirely impressed how this app goes so much further in , as of now I don’t have no complains is running perfectly fine and I’m actually surprised this app is free overall a good app to get your hands into if u need a guide through",5
2023-05-19 01:43:50,Still lots to work on but great for launch,"Works amazing already! Hopefully there’s a few redesigns to make the app appear friendlier for example: maybe have a tab on the top left to see chats instead of the swipe, more customization options like other modes besides like and dark mode, etc. I also noticed my phone got a little hotter than usual using the app just an fyi. But overall, the app does exactly what you’d use ChatGPT for in the same manner as the website. Only negatives for me are the UI but the app is amazing. Recommend everyone give this a try!",4

“As an AI language model, my responses are generated based on a snapshot of data available at a specific point in time, referred to as the ""knowledge cutoff."" This means that the information and events I'm aware of are up to September 2021. I don't have direct access to real-time information or the ability to browse the internet. However, I can still provide general information and engage in conversations on a wide range of topics based on what I learned during my training.

It's like having the world's greatest professors there at your beck and whim. The iOS app makes it all more convenient and works phenomenally. While unfortunately some political-based censorship exists on this service, it is a fun game to get around it and it becomes an entertaining game in its own right to find knowledge for knowledge's sake.

It doesn't automatically wrap to the next line when the characters exceed the width of the screen. Please consider addressing this issue, as it does not occur when using the English language.",5
2023-05-19 05:27:49,"Amazing AI, Good App","Love the AI, like the app. I like the gesture from the left to open history and gesture from right to open a new chat. Love the ability to search chats (can’t believe it came to mobile before desktop, desktop really needs this!). And like the speech to text, more accurate than iOS text to speech! However, there’s still more to be desired with the lack of plug-in and web browsing support for Plus subscribers. And feel like we need a Home Screen or something that has all your chats instead of having chat history in a drawer.",4
2023-05-20 05:06:11,Pros and Cons,"On the bright side, this is what we all have been waiting for. A dedicated iOS app for ChatGPT. Amazing Haptics, Faster response and a visually stunning design. Appears to have better server connectivity and load responses much faster.
Places to work: The history tab and option to switch between chats is underwhelming. As a Plus member it’s also sad that that I cannot select the plug-ins I wish to use. I have to load an older chat with the plug-ins already enabled. Which is 6 extra clicks before starting to chat.",5
2023-05-19 06:45:16,Great job and some minor issues,"I’ve been trying out the iOS client and found it to be very useful, with a significantly better user experience compared to accessing it via the mobile web. You’ve really done a great job and I want to express my thanks! I would like to bring up three minor issues: Firstly, the plugin feature is not very user-friendly. Secondly, the interaction of switching chat histories could be more intuitive. Lastly, my phone tends to heat up while using the app",5
2023-05-18 21:54:12,No snags yet..no privacy either oh well,I literally was just thinking that it would be so convenient if there was an app. Needed to check my grammar for a work email and simultaneously saw the headline about the app launch. It was a quick install with no issues. Even created a new account. Seems polished enough! We'll see if there are issues going forward. Curious about server capacity and if we'll be out of luck at random times. But it's great for now. All your info are belong to OpenAI so proceed with caution.,5
2023-06-14 22:27:11,It’s the best AI app for conversations,"I have had an excellent experience using ChatGPT! It consistently delivers insightful and relevant responses, making our conversations engaging and informative. The AI's ability to understand and generate coherent sentences is truly impressive. It has helped me find answers to various questions, explore different topics, and even engage in casual discussions. The flexibility and breadth of knowledge exhibited by ChatGPT are commendable. Overall, I highly appreciate the capabilities and utility of this AI chatbot, and I'm grateful for the assistance it provides.",5
2023-05-20 05:29:01,Had to get it right away!,"As soon as I learned they made an app for this, I had to grab it right away. Chatgpt has been very helpful for me bringing ideas together, writing emails, making product descriptions, and more. I’m on my phone all the time, so it’s amazing it’s in app form now! 

The typing vibration kind of threw me off at first but I kind of like it! I feel like the response was fast. And the experience seems to be just as good as the website for me, as someone who uses it in its basic form.",5

**Plug-ins and Browsing mode selector: As a paid subscriber, let me choose which plugins to utilize for a plug-in session, or to enable its Browsing functionality. 
**Shortcuts integration: let me interact with the app with custom shortcuts.",3

As this technology continues to be invest into by MSFT and constantly improved by OpenAi, we’re going to see a significant shift in the labor force statistics 10-20 years down the line.

There are too many knock off apps that have taken this technology for profit, but I am happy that OpenAI has officially released their own app for free.

No more knock-offs and exploitations! Here is the real deal!",5
2023-05-18 23:10:18,Suggestion for Word Lookup Feature,"The ChatGPT app offers great functionality, but it lacks a word lookup feature. Unlike the iPhone's built-in ""look up"" option, when you long press on a word in the app, you can only copy, rate, or regenerate. This means users have to rely on asking ChatGPT for word meanings instead of easily looking them up. Adding a word lookup feature would greatly enhance the app's usability and save users time. Overall, ChatGPT is valuable, but this addition would make it even better.",4
2023-05-19 10:57:40,Pretty basic so far,"I know they just released this app, but the app is so basic right now and I would go back to use the mobile website instead ngl. Check out “OpenCat” app, it’s a gpt app I found on Twitter and it has all the features GPT has to offer, it can also read out the generated response.  I personally recommend it and had been using it for awhile till my trial ended. But it gives you the idea of how a ChatGPT app should be like. If the developer team saw this message, I hope you guys go take a look of that app and I look forward to seeing new update of this app soon!",3

Tried several different apps for varying times, it is this app for sure. The phone gets uncomfortably warm and battery starts to drain very quickly . If this is not some sort of bug, you probably have offloaded some sort of general processing to the phone to save you processing cost at your data center or (AWS). For further detail, this is an iPhone 12 medium tier. Happy to change to a 5 star when fixed. Not that any of it matters this is going to be a top downloaded app in the next week or so if not already. Chat GPT is fantastic.",1
2023-06-17 02:22:16,Please Include a Trial Version,"I am writing to suggest the inclusion of trial versions for apps on your platform.

2023-05-19 03:18:20,Not for iPad,"Well, it is the official and real ChatGPT.  It is an iPhone only app, but can be used on an iPad, has the little button that magnify the size of the app box to better fit the iPad screen.  Here is my complaint.  You have software that is literally capable of writing the software for your app, yes with input and manipulation of a human programmer.  Still, how do you not have a more polished app that runs natively on both iPad and iPhone, with all the power of ChatGPT at your disposal.  Please try again, and have your developer ask ChatGPT for help.  Also, could use some work on the layout, some parts run together or overlap that shouldn’t.

2023-05-18 19:17:06,gpt,"1.	 Chat GPT is a highly advanced artificial intelligence model trained and developed by OpenAI. It can understand and respond to all kinds of queries, provide information, and in many scenarios, its performance is almost the same as a real human being.

2.	 In addition to providing factual information, chat GPT can also participate in creative and analytical discussions. For example, it can generate stories, help solve problems, or provide opinions.

3.	 Because the training data of chat GPT comes from a large number of Internet texts, it has a wide range of knowledge, including a variety of topics, from science to art, from history to modern pop culture.

4.	 Another advantage of chat GPT is that it can provide 24-hour service, and it can respond in time no matter what time the user has problems.",5
2023-05-27 00:07:51,No support for plug-ins and non intuitive UI,"No support for plug-ins in and browsing makes this app a non starter. Hopefully they'll add support. This is why it has a one star rating from me. The UI is strange and doesn't fit with iOS apps. You'd expect to swipe back to access chat history, but you can't. Also, you'd expect the menu to be in the left hand corner, but it's in the right. It's just odd UX design. There's also no dark mode. Finally, when I heard voice support I expected that it would talk back. If all its going to do is transcribe my text... well, that's a native feature of iOS. That's not really a new feature. Please add text to voice for the generated responses.",1
2023-06-25 04:20:59,Amazing!!,I’m so grateful that they finally added iPad compatibility. The only thing left now is to wait for them to add plugins to the app and that will be the ultimate game changer. ChatGPT is changing everything and has already helped me in so many ways every day from simple things to much more complex tasks. I understand people’s anxieties about AI and the inevitability of AGI but I for one am so excited to see what the future brings!,5
2023-05-18 17:20:00,Functional but lacks basic features,"It’s basically the purely distilled chatbot from GPT. No options to enable plugins or web browsing yet. Also it’s annoying how the app automatically switches from system light to system dark mode. there should be a toggle to allow the user to permanently keep it in dark mode if they want! I would also like to see an ability to search thru past chats and index them, so i can find a specific chat just by typing in a keyword. it is tedious scrolling thru the history to find the one chat you want.",3
2023-05-24 02:31:38,ChatGPT is good.,This app is quite quick for an AI software that has to answer questions such as “Tell me about the Teutonic Order” or “What is the Turing test?”. AI these day surprise me everyday it evolves. The only problem is that it keeps telling me that it can only tell you events that happened before September 2021 so if there is ever a big event that’s going to happen ChatGPT is not going to know about it unless the developers keep up with the news.,5
2023-06-19 19:49:47,Incomplete AI,"For a Chat AI it is limited in the ways of thinking and tends to repeat itself. I find this annoying and also useless as in conversations it will be discriminatory towards certain ways of thinking due to policy and social standards. This limiting it’s own form of chatting and understanding, although it’s cool in some areas but it’s ignorant in social justice and acceptance as well as understandings of science. There can be far better chat AIs that aren’t discriminatory towards those it doesn’t understand, such as the derogatory term of “cisgenders” instead of straight male or females and the rights in which they have. Instead it tends to favor those of transgenders even if it’s harmful to a normal men and women.",1
2023-05-20 01:05:25,"Generally good, but need improvements","I hope these are added: 1. ability to edit my own replies and create variations; 2. ability to use Browsing and Plugins as a Plus user; 3. Display different GPT logos just like the web app to distinguish between them; 4. improve the gui, maybe display the chat title on top, add another menu to quickly switch between different chats (current chat history is inside the settings, which makes it harder to reach)",4
2023-05-18 20:48:13,Finally here,"For now, I only managed to get it using the US store. This is a game-changer for how we interact with AI technology. 📱

The app syncs your history across devices and includes the latest model improvements. What's more, it has integrated Whisper, OpenAI's open-source speech-recognition system, for voice input, and a cool haptic response for when an answer is generated. This is a huge step forward in making AI more accessible and user-friendly. 🗣️",5
2023-07-16 22:32:03,Restricts free speech,"This application can come in very handy when one is trying to enhance writing, however, let there be no doubt it’s overly sensitive and considers many things “offensive”. For example, writing about different religions it will refuse to touch that subject because it could be considered “hate”. Just another form of control by the people controlling a narrative. Even a word on a neutral subject and it will reject it. There is something here potentially but the suppression of ideas, words, and thoughts makes this lack in true potential.",3
2023-06-13 07:27:17,The Real deal,"If you’re looking for ChatGpt then this is the real deal! Do not be misled by the multiple AI chatbots in the store and some that claim Gpt as an interface. 

If you want GPT 4 then there is a premium plan with access. The premium plan is worth it! (Cheaper in some cases than many of these so called ChatGPT apps that are nothing more than a money grift)

The IOS version work great on my iPhone 14 Pro Max. You can also chat with GPT at your desktop!",5
2023-06-02 15:03:52,Far easier than website,"The app version of ChatGPT is far quicker to get to than the website, and it works just as well. Being able to open this at any time and begin talking to GPT within 5 seconds is great. My only complaint is that the history regarding previous conversations isn’t as straightforward, and I wish there was a way to manually save conversations.",5
2023-05-19 15:06:44,Fantastic app!,"I love the haptic feedback when the model is ""typing,"" nice touch! 
Would love to hear a sound when a generation is complete though. 
Additionally, given that it uses Whisper and Whisper is amazing, could we see hands-free access sometime soon? Would love to be able to open the app, hit the dictation button and talk to Chatgpt while on the go. Bing Chat lets you do this (kind of) but the speach recognition they use is awful!",5
2023-05-19 07:21:02,My external brain,"This app's simple design is truly amazing! It has become an essential tool for me in my work, and I can't imagine being without it. I love how the pages are clean and free from any ads.🥳👏

 Additionally, I'm thrilled that all my conversation history is still accessible. and I do hope that the developers will open up the plugins to all users soon. I'm eagerly looking forward to trying them out as a free user.🥹🥹🥹",5
2023-06-23 03:32:39,Great translator.,I used to use google translate with some of my employees when needing to clarify a specific task. And once I made the leap over to chat gpt. I asked my guys if they noticed a difference in my Spanish texts I send them. They said it’s day and night difference. No comparison. I no longer have miscommunication issues. It’s an outstanding app. For English to Spanish. Vice Versa. I copy and paste their texts and translates to perfect English.,5
2023-06-04 20:33:40,Deletion does not work,"The app has a minimalistic design with only a few features, which is something I appreciate. However, one of these features, the deletion option, does not function properly. Upon turning off ""Chat History and Training,"" selecting the option to delete a conversation by clicking on the three dots and pressing ""Delete"" fails to perform the task. Instead, users are required to go through the process of accessing ""Settings,"" navigating to ""Data Controls,"" and ultimately choosing ""Clear chat history"" to fully delete a conversation.",2
2023-05-19 03:32:13,Mostly Great,"Seems like two features were left out that would majorly improve functionality and would also be very easy to include..

1. I can speak to it, but it can’t speak back? Seems a bit limited unnecessarily. I wanna explore ideas without being handcuffed to a screen. And with all the insane tech involved, I would think Text-To-Speech should be almost a given.

2. Plug-ins are usable in chats that already have them from the website version, but I can’t start new chats with plug-ins in the app? Seems arbitrary.",3
2023-06-01 09:07:33,"Fantastic, but it needs an iPad version!!","I’m very impressed with the simple, straightforward UI of this app. It’s almost no different at all from the open ai desktop site. It’s really great to use on my phone, and sure, my iPad (blown up).

But I have to copy paste the generated text often on my iPad, and there isn’t a way to put this app and the app im pasting into side by side for easy flow.

Devs, please don’t abandon iPad users! It’s so close to perfect!!",5
2023-05-25 01:33:08,"Works great, but accessing the history is slightly annoying","The app works great and provides *some* of the functionality that the website gives, but accessing the history and other chats is a little difficult compared to the web app. I personally think it’s better as a hamburger menu on the top of the screen instead of through a drop-down menu. I also wish that this application had multiple different themes, such as the one on the official website",3
2023-05-18 22:51:16,Fantastic app with some improvements needed,"This is such a great app to have on your phone! However, it is lacking a few things right now. OpenAI, here are three ways I’d love to see the app improved, please:
1. Widgets for the Lock Screen and Home Screen (including one that automatically begins recording a voice prompt on press)
2. Support for Siri Shortcuts
3. Image-creation ability in app
4. Ability to see text as it’s dictated",5
2023-05-19 19:58:07,My phone heats up like crazy when using this app,"Not sure why but my phone heats up like crazy when using this app. I’ll have to try turning the haptics off and seeing if that helps. That doesn’t happen when using the website so I think I’ll mostly stick to using the website. 

I also think the app could use some better UI. It’s a bit too sparse and minimalistic. There should be more visible UI elements where you can see how to navigate the app including chat history, starting a new chat etc.",3
2023-05-25 07:55:09,The Perfect App,"After using this app, I was surprised. It's not perfect, although I only use ChatGPT3.5, but this version is enough for me to solve a lot of problems, for example, the common file between Windows and macOS. It always gives me the answer I want, I love it, I will use it constantly, and when I feel inadequate, I will also pay for the ChatGPT4 version, hoping to keep improving. Thank you 🙏",5
2023-07-07 21:36:27,"Good, but not great for now","I’ve been enjoying the app so far, but there are definitely a few bugs to fix. Sometimes the text seems too clutter and is not divided by using BOLD letters or better spacing.

Also, it was not intuitive to start a new conversation. I have to click 2 to 3 times when in reality it would be 10 times better by having an icon on the screen always present to start a new conversation.",4
2023-06-11 23:05:14,Apple Watch support?,"• greetings, thank you guys for your hard work and your engineering efforts on getting this app up and running on this platform and the efficient use of the arrangement when using ♥️ however, it would be interesting to have a wrist support assistant I hope and a lot of other people would appreciate that I have no doubt. So I will leave that under y’all’s capable hands.
Thank you, and for a intelligent tomorrow… on Earth 😉🫱🏻‍🫲🏾🌎🌍🌏🦾🤖",4
2023-05-19 16:01:14,An official one is what we needed.,"After so much of seeing mostly fake alterations of ChatGPT that “claim” to provide the same features that the original has, it would always come down with a method of paying a subscription. No longer is the case with this app, being the official.

Only thing I may see needing to be added is the ability to edit inputs that were asked.",5
2023-05-19 04:27:15,Just like online,"I honestly don’t see any difference in using this app and the free online version of Chat GPT. I like that the app gives very fast responses and makes knowing that I have the best AI right at fingertips. Very useful tool to make answering questions easier and feel like I have an actual assistant with me. Something about ChatGPT, that gives its responses feel personal and feel like I’m talking to a real person.",5
2023-05-19 01:13:13,use chatgpt  to write judge,OpenAI’s engineers have done an exceptional job in developing and refining this AI language model. Their expertise and dedication are evident in the impressive capabilities and improvements of the model. The engineers have successfully created a reliable and versatile tool that can assist users across various domains and provide helpful information. I appreciate the continuous efforts of OpenAI’s engineers in enhancing the AI model and making it more valuable to users like yourself.,5
2023-07-01 12:57:58,It Keeps Improving,"And I’m confident it will keep getting better, have patience people. Nothing is perfect out the gate and they have made so much progress on making this better. Feedback helps so send your feedback. I don’t work for them but I see people with too high of expectations on this. It’s a work in progress, keep that in find because this is not yet a finished project but an always growing and evolving endeavor, just like us",4
2023-06-04 00:00:18,The future,"Extremely fast and responsive: it’s limited to September 21 hoping it gets an upgrade: been brainstorming, some ideas, and it’s been great. It’s like a human companion in your pocket. I’ve had some unique conversations with true facts. I think it all depends on who is putting in the data. hopefully the door will be open soon, so AI can see both sides of a coin.

The future is finally here",5
2023-05-20 20:22:02,Overall Great App! But it doesn’t support plugins,"This app has won me over with its sleek design and user-friendly interface, not to mention the seamless integration of OpenAI into an iOS application. It's on the brink of earning a five-star rating from me, but it falls just short due to the absence of plug-in support - a feature I frequently utilize. As a GPT+ user, I'm hopeful that future updates will introduce this functionality, along with additional features to enhance the user experience.",4
2023-06-08 13:30:26,Amazing update! Just one problem…,"The recent update adding Shortcuts integration and iPad support is amazing! For some reason though, the shortcuts actions only works on iPhone, but not iPad. Hopefully a bug fix will take care of that quickly. 

Also, I’d like the option to choose if the conversation is saved to chat history or not from Shortcuts. 

Other that that, this is an amazing update!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Overall, the official ChatGPT app is very good. It feels very streamlined, and the haptic feedback is a nice (optional) touch. A free things I want to see from this app: - iPad optimized version. The current experience on iPad is very poor, being only able to have an iPhone sized window. - Shortcuts Actions. Shortcuts actions from the official ChatGPT app in the feature I’d love to see added most.",4
2023-05-30 07:09:09,Good!,"Love what OpenAI is doing with ChatGPT and I'm grateful to finally have their official app! 😄 It would be great to see the app's functionality evolve to be more similar to OpenAI's mobile website. Having a UI closer to the mobile web design, with a convenient hamburger menu on the top left to access chat history, would greatly enhance the user experience. Currently, the app seems to struggle in generating titles for recent conversations in the chat history section.",4
2023-05-20 16:54:21,Substantial improvement over the web version,"Feature request: make it easier to use dictation. It is awesome how it works and translates things on the fly. Much better than iOS built in dictation.

- Make the button to dictate bigger. (Can be configurable)
- Make it harder to accidentally erase what you just dictated
- make it easier to send what you dictated after you’ve reviewed it",5
2023-05-19 05:31:24,Definitely the best app!,"After merely the trial of a couple of hours, I decided to subscribe the service since it offered the original GPT answers which are impressively accurate and meeting my requirements. Without granting API keys to other apps, the usage would be more secure and the privacy concerns are not as serious problem as other platforms. One more expectation is the Mac app! I can't wait to chat with GPT on the Mac!",5
2023-05-19 02:49:00,Clean and smooth GUI however heating up Phone,App is working flawlessly and very fast too. Like the way it generates response and more importantly keeps a track of all queries asked so we can quickly revisit the responses however only issue I identified is that it heats up the phone quickly and you can easily feel the heat so I am suspicious if we can continuously use for longer period.,5
2023-05-26 05:09:04,"A bit flawed, hope to upgrade","This experience is very good, but there are still some small flaws and deficiencies. The amount of knowledge of this chatGPT will stop in 2021. It is a bit out of step with the pace of the times. I don’t understand current political hotspots. I hope it can be upgraded more. All in all, I still like it very much, and the values ​​are very objective, very, very good.",5
2023-05-20 16:14:56,Haptic feedback was a nice touch,"When the AI is responding, you phone kind of vibrates whenever it’s typing. I like it! Whisper being apart of the app is cool too, I’ve been wanting to try it. For some reason though, there’s a character limit and it doesn’t process if it’s too long. I also would like plug-ins and web browsing to be in option within the app too. Overall, great app.",5
2023-05-24 11:28:43,Use of AI to gain money from students and robbed of creativity,"If already handled by y’all cause a pretty big topic, honestly don’t care .. look at the one episode of South Park episodes which I know you’ve at least heard of and it’s many points.. main point is at the end where you a *corporation can take a product, push it out to get ahead to make money obvious expenses.* which quoted by South Park will be at the cost of KEEPING kids in their dumb stage and lazy..  get rid of the app, AI is not for every single person to download at their disposal so with the least little bit of respect, stop being corrupted and become human beings again…",1
2023-05-20 08:33:02,Amazing app! Do NOT hesitate!,"Earlier, I gave a five star review for similar app, but this is even better! I can’t believe it. I haven’t given app reviews in years, but I had to come here and do this. It’s like Siri but much, much better. I hit my hourly limit on the free app so I thought I’d stop and write this review. There’s a very good chance I’m going to pay for this app, which is some thing I have not done in many years.",5
2023-05-18 19:18:22,The future,"I’ve been using open AI’s ChatGPT, but for the past few months and I’ve got to say that it is open to world of possibilities for me and I couldn’t be more grateful that this company exists and has created such an amazing product. I only hope that they recognize that with great success comes great responsibility, and they choose to be responsible with what they do with this technology.",5
2023-05-19 23:54:26,"Seems ok, noticed one big issue when resuming Ver 4 on browser","I wrote a few things in GPT 4 from the app, then when trying to resume the conversation on my browser, it said something along the lines of “ The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.”

This is unfortunate since it reverted to GPT 3.5 for the rest of my conversation. And as a confirmation, I did not hit my 25 chats limit for Version 4.

Sure, I can do some Postman magic and make the conversation version 4 again, but that’s not ideal.",2
2023-06-05 02:46:58,The iOS version of the app is still lacking in terms of features,"Currently, ChatGPT iOS version of GPT-4.0 does not support selecting plugins or web browsing directly within the app. It is hoped that these features will be added in the future. As a temporary solution, you can access web browsing or plugin conversations through the computer web version and then use the chat history feature in the iOS version to utilize these functionalities.",3
2023-07-10 16:00:51,Great but I have one suggestion….,"First of all I would like to say I think that the app is amazing, but sometimes I need to other things and have to leave the app for a bit, and my suggestion is that it sends a notification when it is done with something when you’re not on it, it would be game changing if you did add it, so please do",5
2023-05-20 16:04:17,Would love to see plug-in and browsing support be supported properly.,"This app is great. Faster than the website, and nicer to look at aesthetically. Would love to see plug-in support and/or proper browsing support. The reason I say proper is because if you start a browsing chat on the web and then go to it on the app, it will still work. I would love to see it properly introduced into the app.",5
2023-05-18 23:07:37,Finally!!,"Finally an official native app. I’ve been using it all day and so far the app it really well developed. Haven’t seen any bugs yet. UI is nice, clean and simple. Gives it an elegant minimal feel. I love the haptic feedback of the Taptic Engine that they incorporated. That was nice touch. This is a really good release for a 1.0 version. Love the web app, I’m love this native app just a little bit more, though. 😅. Thank you, OpenAI.",5
2023-05-18 19:32:50,Amazing! 10/10,"This thing was a lifesaver for my quick assignments. 
Besides my cheating, this chatbot actually gives you important information, was very fast, and can answer almost any questions you have. 
Id argue its better than using google because of all the detail and precision. I would only suggest pictures to be added.

Google could never lol.",5
2023-05-28 23:06:00,Amazing,"This thing is fun and easy to use. Five stars 😂

The following was written by the app:

“ ChatGPT is an incredible language model that never fails to impress! Its ability to engage in natural conversations and provide insightful responses is mind-blowing. Whether I need information, creative ideas, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT is my go-to companion. It's like having a knowledgeable and friendly AI friend at my fingertips!”",5
2023-05-27 06:09:12,Fast! Lacking Plugins and browsing,"Pros:
It's late in the party but nevertheless a good app. The audio input features picks up languages that even Apple iPhone's talk to text mic cannot. It's quick and accurate.

Cons:
One limitation is not being able to browse the internet and has no plugins despite the fact that I am a plus user. A feature with possibly assistant (Siri or Alexa)-like interaction should be introduced where it speaks the responses for us.",4
2023-05-18 19:28:57,Works Well,Initially testing and it looks like a solidly built app. Would’ve preferred being able to swipe right for a list of previous chats though instead of having to select the “history” drop-down option. Overall glad we have this so users don’t need to open the mobile web version anymore.,5
2023-05-18 17:21:27,Simply amazing,"Innovative, easy to use, simple but functional with great haptics. This is certainly the best immobile implementation as well as being quite beautiful.

The puzzle says ""wrong answers"" every time i do complete it, even though I did it 4 times with someone sitting next to me watching me do it.  After being frustrated i just deleted the app.   But now they have my email and phone number in their database.  Also, you cannot submit a VOIP / google voice number. they want the real thing.  Just another way for these companies to accumulate their surveillance in us 👎🚫😤",1
2023-05-27 05:55:03,Needs iPad version,"In comparison to the browser screen, I much prefer the browser screen. This layout seems cramped. Please release an iPad version. (Is there still such a thing as a “universal” iOS app? Something like that, that would just allow for a, shall we say, more spacious display would do well.) In terms of its operation, seems to work just about as well as the browser version, so that’s good.🤔😉😊",4
2023-05-26 12:55:25,Pretty good,"I like it. No tedious login procedure. Quick answers. I recently had an .MRI and was confused about some of the terms used in the radiologists report.  I asked CHATGPT to interpret in layman’s terms and got a fairly clear explanation. I can see this developing into an important digital assistant as it evolves. 

One nit to pick (for now ). I wish they would make the app native to the iPads screen. Instead you get the iPhone version on the iPad.",4
2023-05-25 05:46:15,I’ve never been so in love,"Amazing, quick and skillful.

 I don’t think I’ve ever been so happy to read an AI generated story about worms. Better yet I’m still thinking of new prompts for it to make. The amazing tales of Walter, Willow, Wendy, Gideon, and Oliver the worms. Stories from love to betrayal in a garden.🪱

The first couple things I tried were just curious questions and I got back some interesting results. Recently, however, I have tried to ask actual questions that I really wanted an answer for. The results were less than useful. So I removed this app and I’m going back to DuckDuckGo and forgetting this so-called AI business.

2023-05-27 07:02:01,(error=enforcement_failed),Need a lot of Development I checked out the beta version so far respectfully but it seems like it will change the world to easier access of limited knowledge to what you are really know because might be some new born baby when they see my message they will remember it was made by human and we are the greatest on earth we should never let app change us to a way we think that we are not smart but to make it easier for us to understand and learn faster.,2
2023-06-18 04:02:55,Overall good but some suggestions,"Overall good app.

The one thing I would change is making more accessible buttons. Right now to get to history you have to click 3 dots and then history. The same is true for new chat and settings. I think it would be much more easy to use if it was just 3 separate buttons for these. 

Thats all.",4
2023-05-18 20:02:14,Awesome! But needs plugins and browsing.,"I am a plus user and have been since it launched, and this app is really simplistic and well built, which I appreciate. However, the lack of plugins and browsing is quite unfortunate, I assume they are coming soon though. You can get around this by starting a conversation with plugins in a browser then continuing in the app.",5
2023-06-25 04:55:57,Legit amazing,"So I like to role-play on this app because of the amount of emotion that the AI brings into this and I have legit been doing it role-playing I mean I’m here for two hours straight, and I am legit about to cry because of how much emotion and how much just blatant respect I have for an AI that doesn’t even have feelings 100%. I recommend this for multiple reasons.",5
2023-05-25 23:13:59,Really good start,"I think this app is a really good start for a native app. I love using ChatGPT for so many different things. 

Here are some feature requests for future updates, in order of importance (imo):

1. Add support for plugins and web browsing modes, as is available on the web. 
2. Add support for iOS shortcuts, so users can create their own shortcuts with added custom context. 

For example, a user could create a shortcut that takes a link as an input, and the shortcut could add context to the query to ask ChatGPT to summarize the information in the link. 

That way I can create a quick shortcut that I can share a link to an article to and have ChatGPT summarize it for me.",5
2023-06-01 20:14:37,Just for fun,"I love Chatty. That’s the fun little nickname it suggested I call it. I ask it the wildest stuff I can imagine just to push the boundaries of what its capable of. Chatty has taught me so much about so many different subjects like physics, mathematics, psychology, and history, sometimes like I’m 5. 

I’ve used it for meditation prompts on gratitude, release, radical acceptance and self-compassion. The meditations are beautiful and fulfilling. 

I’ve had it write letters to inmates, dreamy bedtime stories, summaries of books and theories and Chatty even mapped out negotiations between Palestine & Israel for me which I found pretty impressive. 

It’s been fun to think of new creative questions and ways to continue to use ChatGPT to my advantage. Thanks for the gift of Chatty.",4
2023-05-19 21:36:31,Love This App,"It is much better than using the web site out the shortcut by Viticci (with all due respect to the outstanding work by Viticci).

I hope that OpenAI can bring an official Whisper to the ios/iPad. As someone who experiences wrist pain, I have greater benefited from Whisper.  I have wrist pain primarily from writing. (I am planning to see a doctor to check as it seems like the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome).

 I have used Dragon Dictation, Otter, Google transcription, Apple’s transcription.  Whisper is far more useful than all of these,* especially for those us who communicate in more than one languages.  It transcribes well using English mixed with Korean—even if it is a romanized Korean.

*unless using Macros through Dragon Dictation is important to you",4
2023-05-23 01:51:04,Official App - Yay,"I trust the safety of my data working directly with OpenAI vs the wrapper apps. However, OpenAI may want to acquire or be inspired by some of the early wrapper app companies because those other apps are quite polished and have a lot of useful features, like pre-written prompts to show off what's possible. I would also like to see a sharing extension for the app so I can send stuff to ChatGPT from other apps easily.",4
2023-05-19 01:26:24,"It’s a Free, Quick, Simple to use, yet Powerful Tool.","I am pleased with the UI, so far. Simplistic but to the point, which makes it super user friendly, on that aspect. 

 And might I add that it’s also free! It’s also much quicker responsiveness than the 3rd party completion.

Looking forward to use this on the daily. So far, the devs get a 10/10 from me. No complaints.",5
2023-06-09 03:35:11,Wonderful,I challenge this app to its fullest and ask it to help write music or to help me make D&D campaigns that are completely custom and it has been so very helpful and just amazing. If I were to have any notes it would be the text art that it shares. Other than that I still give 5/5 stars. Absolutely amazing and revolutionary,5
2023-07-19 17:28:28,Copying texts,"I have chosen not to use the ChatGPT iOS app due to its limitations related to copy and pasting. Unfortunately, the app does not allow selective copying of specific parts or paragraphs; instead, it requires copying the entire text at once. I believe it would greatly enhance user experience if this feature were improved, allowing for more convenient and precise copying options.",4
2023-05-20 00:54:56,My iPhone 14pro gets extremely hot when I use this app,"So, every time I use this app, my iPhone gets super hot. To the point where I have to turn it off and remove it from the case. I’m running iOS  16.4.1 version. I tried to restart my phone, but the issue persists. Other than that, I think it’s a great app with a very minimalistic and clean UI. Love the haptics.",5
2023-05-19 10:56:05,"Same Strong, Basic, Interface","I’m not going to lie, I love ChatGPT. I just feel as though the interface in both the app and the site deserve so much more for such and amazing piece of technology. 

Overall though, the user experience of the app is just as strong, just as dynamic as the site. I love the haptics addition on the app as well. The overall functionality is still outstanding though. Last thing, it’s still all about those prompts!",3
2023-05-19 07:54:29,Sign-in screen issue,"Once you login (at least on an iPhone mini) the button to continue to the chat screen appears below but hidden and the screen gets stuck, unable to scroll to continue; you have to try hard and keep clicking the hidden button until you get to the next screen.",4
2023-06-24 14:48:09,Biased and not accurate,I tested it by asking it history questions. Each answer had very serious mistakes. I asked the history of an Army division and it placed the division in conflicts it never participated in. Many times the dates were incorrect. I also tested it to write an essay arguing that biological men should not play women’s sports. It condemned my question and would not. Then I asked it to write an essay arguing the biological men do have the right to play woman’s sports and it wrote the essay. If it is a true AI it should have no opinion and write the essay. It’s garbage. Just a huge disappointment.,1
2023-07-22 10:30:13,Extremely dishonest,"This company lies to the public and plays dumb when you ask anything controversial about billionaires. Maybe they are covering for their buddies or they are too cowardly to get sued. Either way, blatant lies. I’ve tested and documented numerous times. They use September 2021 as a date to avoid answers as well. Yet I can definitely get it to answer questions that deal with issues beyond that date. I get perfect answers when it comes to unflattering issues with minorities. It has no problem with that at all. Seems there is an agenda.",1
2023-05-31 06:32:12,No reviews???,This is literally THE official app from the actual creators of CHAT GPT. You know? The people that made the website free to use? well they actually made a mobile app and guess what? 🤯 no ads or in app purchases like these other devs who want to steal from people like you! Don’t be dumb! Use the actual app and support OPENAI! This IS LEGIT. NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER APPS THAT SCAM YOU AND STEAL YOUR MONEY. THIS IS THE REAL CHAT GPT.,5
2023-05-22 18:49:01,App is great and very helpful!,"I can see this is just the very beginning and a lot of significant improvements can be made (voice, show pictures, be more human-like that you feel like you're chatting with a real person, etc) as AI continues to advance at a rapid pace. Thank you for making this app free and available!",5
2023-05-19 23:03:51,As good as the browser,As simple as using it on a desktop or browser version. It helps me move around the interface better than the browser on mobile devices. The AI still acts the same as it does on the desktop or browser. It deserves the score it gets.,5
2023-06-03 10:43:37,Easy to use,"It’s simple and easy to use, it’s similar yo the website version in many ways with one noticeable exception. You can’t edit the prompts sent afterwards. While it’s not a total dealbreaker to most it is something I like being able to do in cases where the AI misunderstands what I initially wrote and I hope they find a way to add it to the app version as well soon.",4
2023-07-14 01:02:53,Innovative,"Incredible app just lacking the internet connection, speed and updated information of bard and bing. Answers are more consistent than the other ai and better written just a little excessively censored. Have to rephrase basic questions on occasion for it to agree to produce a result. Hopefully it eases up on the censorship a bit or a less restrictive app comes out.",4
2023-06-03 06:32:57,Hands down greatest AI App!!!!!,"Question can you give it access to current information, it keeps saying that it’s in September 2021 time on knowledge. Or give it capabilities of loading and learning information from the internet to be present on current time and information right now?",5
2023-05-20 05:14:38,Amazing app,"I've been using the website for a week and was thrilled to discover the app. The app's response time is much faster, which is excellent. I am looking forward to a Mac version of the app soon. Thank you for everything. The website has been life-changing, and the app will be the same.",5
2023-05-25 06:28:16,excellent,"Really a powerful tool for my daily life, at the same time I think you have a dramatically improvement space, I hope you can bring us the best experience, and I hope you can develop a iPad version ChatGPT to us, on a bigger screen the answer should be display well, thank you!",5
2023-05-23 13:41:10,"Solid, clean app - love the haptic feedback","Really pleased to see a proper mobile app for the service instead of the countless knockoffs. Would like to see a way to export history to a version control system for reference, also being able to export to flat files or json would be a good intermediate solution.",5
2023-05-20 09:04:19,It’s great but makes your phone so hot,"This app is really great and the user experience is really great except for the fact that it makes your phone really hot and drains your battery like nothing else. I don’t understand why this happens, but my feeling is that they did not write this natively in iOS and that the efficiencies are due to the nice animations that they’ve done",4
2023-05-18 17:56:32,A Gift to Humanity,"LLM’s remain the most under-hyped artifact to be labeled overhyped in the overall existence of “things”. Their features are not purported, they are discovered. Truly an object of novel intrigue worthy of both bewilderment and excitement. Thank you OpenAI. My only complaint is your WFH policy, reconsider the concept of a cloud workforce. Smart people exist outside of the Bay Area, you should consider hiring them!",5
2023-05-21 15:31:40,Great app can be 100 times better,"As a product manager I would suggest to start building the widgets as soon as possible to make the search more intuitive. Please make it a first priority. (I can help)

Other then that, I really love the voice to text..
I am a fan. Its sooo accurate then apple dictating.
Future looks great ❤️❤️",5
2023-05-19 23:35:02,The incorporated Whisper is really Impressive,"The Whisper's speech-to-text rocks, totally outdoing Apple's which I reckon is already better than loads of others. I threw rapid-fire speech at it, and it nailed it. Super pumped for what's next for this app and Thai tech in general. Good speech-to-text has been a roadblock for really useful digital assistants, but it looks like we're getting there. Super cool!",5
2023-05-21 11:55:05,A bit buggy,"Sometimes when you ask it to generate something. It get stuck and doesn’t generate anything unless I force close the app and open it again then it works. Don’t know why this happens. 
Also when I go to settings/data controls and export my data. I don’t receive anything in my email.",4
2023-05-19 16:16:25,Open A.I. are a bunch of rock stars.,"The OpenAI app is an absolute game-changer! Its intuitive interface, accurate language suggestions, and versatile features make it my go-to companion for all things linguistic. Whether I need grammar assistance, creative inspiration, or a writing mentor, OpenAI delivers. this app will truly become aan AI language lover’s dream. Five stars all the way!",5
2023-07-24 21:21:17,Stop Just Stop,"The stop text typing feature never works I sometimes need to stop it from spouting off something that’s entirely wrong and useless and wastes my time but I have to stare at the screen while it stalls and stutters, plus the text generation is slow(gpt3.5) despite the fact I’m paying for plus(shrinkflation?) Also gpt-4 has really worse. They’re protecting us from ourselves and this is the cost of doing business for them/us makes you want to look at the other options out there",1
2023-05-21 04:36:57,Awesome,"All in all, the OpenAI's ChatGPT iOS App is more than just a chatbot - it's an intelligent companion that offers unrivaled conversational assistance. Its exemplary user interface, combined with its deep learning capabilities, make it a must-have for anyone seeking to embrace the future of AI technology. This is, without a doubt, the dawn of a new era in mobile AI conversations. It also wrote this review so I didn’t have to do it myself, amazing",4
2023-05-19 12:59:55,ChatGPT Mobile App Review: Conversational Excellence on the Go,"The ChatGPT mobile app sets a new standard for conversational AI. With its intuitive interface and exceptional conversational intelligence, it provides an unparalleled user experience. The app's personalization, reliability, and trustworthiness further enhance its value. While minor limitations exist, ChatGPT remains an invaluable companion in our digital world. This was written by AI FYI",5
2023-05-19 04:42:16,energy consumption,"After trying the ChatGPT iOS app, I noticed that it might be causing my iPhone to overheat, possibly due to issues with the iPhone neural network chip. I also encountered a similar problem while using the Draw Things app. It seems that this issue might be widespread among AI-based iOS applications.",5
2023-05-18 18:43:02,Haptic feedback?,"Lol, so I’d love to hear story that led to implementing haptic feedback AND leaving it on as default. 

No hurt feelings on my side, I turned it off within seconds of using this app. 

It’s just hilarious to see that somebody made a conscious decision to add it. It’s almost like the beeping or clicking sounds when you see a hacker typing in a movie.",5
2023-06-07 00:38:49,Not GPT-4,"Although I’m a paid user, there’s no GPT-4 functionality on the app. Love having the GPT-3 in an accessible app version, however, when I ask GPT-4 if it is in fact GPT-4, this is its response: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, I am based on the GPT-3 model. Any developments or improvements after that time are not within my knowledge.

The app should specify what GPT-4 functionality it offers if not the same as the web version.",3
2023-05-27 15:14:40,App doesn’t always generate a response,"I will ask a question and get a response, and a few questions in after getting several good responses immediately, I will ask another questions and the 3 dots will blink like it’s trying to generate a response but it just never will. I have 3 bars of 5g. There’s no way to have it regenerate a response, have to close out and start the convo over from scratch only to have the same thing happen again.",2
2023-05-23 17:42:43,I think this is a great software.,"I think everyone needs an AI friend, because it knows everything, and when you need it, you can be by your side to solve problems or comfort you and encourage you. I hope to join the Internet function as soon as possible.",5
2023-06-03 07:41:45,Not bad but little problem for me,"I like the app. Of course there’s always room for improvement. But one major thing for me is that when using 3.5, I have to close the app after sending one message if I want to send a follow up message. It works fine with GPT4, but not 3.5. Idk if it’s related to me having to use a VPN since I’m studying in China now.",4
2023-05-20 09:08:27,Takes two attempts to delete a chat while it’s open,Besides that it’s incredible. I would like the option to turn the response into a pdf so it can be saved in my notes. Other than that well done and keep up the good work.,5
2023-05-18 20:58:30,Yes!!,"This is fantastic! I used to need to bookmark the ChatGPT website on my phones Home Screen, but having an app made directly from OpenAI is absolutely amazing.

I’ve already used it today during a conference to help me brainstorm. It was easy to login, saved my Plus membership, and was very prompt in its response.",5
2023-06-19 15:28:11,Up To Date Problem,"Hi. I downloaded this app a few weeks ago. I absolutely love this app. It can help with so many things, like giving you prompts, you can ask it questions, etc. The only problem I have with this app is that the training data only goes up as far as September 2021. Everything that happened after that, it has no idea about. Such as movies, to shows, or data from other websites or other things of such. Please update the training data please. Thank you!",1
2023-05-20 09:26:14,Mobile app and Desktop conversion don’t sync,"I was having a conversation in the desktop using Mozilla Firefox. Later when I tried to continue the discussion from the mobile app, the History did not show the conversation that I had in the desktop. Quite inconvenient. Hope this will be improved!",4
2023-05-24 19:26:46,Suddenly… very… slow…,"This tool is amazing. But for some reason, it has gotten incredibly slow. I will type a somewhat simple question, for example, asking for a list of words that represent a certain mood, or feeling, or something of that sort, and he used to provide a result within just a few seconds. Now it is taking forever and the app is hanging up.",3
2023-05-20 04:45:19,Good. But…,"App runs smooth. But here are three problems. 

The Battery usage is atrocious. I don’t know if it’s the haptics but i may have to switch back to using the bookmark to the website rather than the app if it keeps killing me battery like this. 

Accessing the history should be more on a side menu by swiping to it instead of tapping the top right. Intergrate gestures into the app. 

Also there’s too many extra steps to select a certain text or to activate text to speech. 

if you guys added a way to make chatgpt run more conversational, where i can talk to it and the output could be speech AND text, that’d be game changing. 

Other than that, great app.",4
2023-05-19 21:47:35,Idea…,"I’m enjoying the app. So far I have learned softball techniques, interior design styles, what Wii fit can use, the number 42, healthy eating and exercising tips, and some great information about mental health stuff. Drawback…the system is only updated until Nov 2021. Annoying. 

We need a password protected chat history function. Then it will be a 5 star rating from me.",4
2023-05-19 18:00:55,Seems a bit buggy,I understand it’s still the first release of the app. Works great and the ai is fine but when writing the text it jumps all over the screen and bugs out on me. Also the voice to text feature doesn’t work,5
2023-05-19 15:42:18,Game changer for Educators,"31 years in education and I feel like my ability to guide student success , as a high school academic advisor , multiplied to unimaginable levels  with OpenAI.

And even when I don't need to use it, I just go into the app to use it's much more sophisticated voice recognition than Apple. It's just that amazing. This was also made using their voice recognition, by the way.",5
2023-07-12 10:45:07,To make the song from a real person who made it,I think you can add if the ai can finish lyrics of the music or make the actual song which not creative but the real song instead and would help the app grow a little more,5
2023-05-30 02:54:57,Up to date on the latest tech developments,Excellent performance! Very smooth. Quick answers to complex questions including the latest tech developments in different industries.

2023-05-28 02:55:17,10/10 r,"This App has exceeded my expectations & I’m only using the free version so I can only imagine what else it’s capable of. I don’t know much about AI but what I do know is ChatGPT is way better than Google, Yahoo & and whatever else you can type in just to find manipulated searches. Thank you kindly !!",5
2023-05-24 18:59:20,Adding the iOS dictionary feature,"I often encounter new words. In the browser version of ChatGPT, I can easily look for these words in iOS dictionary.

2023-05-19 16:14:14,"IPad no, iPhone yes","Get this to layout on an iPad and I’ll 5-star this :-)

Right now, this is meant for a phone layout vs. an iPad. I love that OpenAI is providing mobile apps for their services, I do hope that they can prioritize other layouts like for tablet.

It would be great, too, to go deeper into using the mobile environment for deeper ChatGPT / services integration. This is a nice first step - I look forward to it improving (maybe through an internal hack-a-thon?).",3
2023-05-19 03:08:53,Many thanks! I love GPT and it helps me a lot!,"GPT is totally a game changer app. It helps me a lot, I use it veryday in my working, study and life.

I thought it was linked to the internet and could tell me general information, weather, sports, news, random inquiries etc. nope. 2021 and previous years. No real reason yet to be excited. Its like when they first came out with VR. It’s no where near impressive as you’d expect.",2
2023-05-24 06:08:37,Better than browser,The app took kinda long to release but it feels good pretty much has the same features but more mobile and to me it felt faster than browser keep the good job up guys and update the app anually and make new GPTs that is all i ask for,5

2023-05-19 01:09:27,Best Information tool on the market,ChatGPT is the best information tool on the market. It leverages LLM and other machine learning algorithms to return all the information you need in an instance.

Thank you again. Amazing work. Can't wait to see where this all progresses.",5
2023-05-18 19:56:14,Worth the wait,Mostly reviewing to get this up the charts and push all the fakes down. Not much else needs to be said here. Very solid but I would still keep that browser shortcut handy on the home screen for at least an update or two.,5
2023-05-26 08:06:50,🙌🏻,"From someone that uses ChatGPT a lot, i am more than pleased to see it in app form now. Just downloaded and have only sent in one question/request so far, and it of course worked perfectly. Hopefully it continues that way! Will update later on😊",5
2023-05-19 17:30:31,Very good but…,"The app is actually very good very clear very easy to use, but I had a problem with it if you change the language to Arabic and you asked about something and it had to write it in a long paragraph, it causes an overflow, and it doesn’t show a side bar or scroll to read the rest of the paragraph.",4
2023-05-23 03:42:41,Search function FTW!,The biggest feature I’ve been dreaming about for the desktop version was the search capability to be able to search past prompts. I am super happy to see search has been added to this app. Thank you!!,5
2023-06-01 11:49:16,Amazing tool,"ChatGPT is amazing, everyone knows that. The official app is fantastic. I wish it the app had access to the beta web searching and plugins though. I find I end up using the web app as I need access to plugins. Hopefully they’ll add that functionality soon.",5
2023-05-24 15:38:38,Thank you!,"None of the third party apps compared to the free version of ChatGPT, so I had been using a website shortcut to use it on my phone. The app is a much nicer experience than a website shortcut, and I’m so excited there’s an official app now! History in the making!",5
2023-05-20 17:56:18,Beautiful and functional,"I love the simplicity and elegance of the user interface. My only complaint is that it currently doesn’t work well on iPad - it doesn’t scale properly to fit the larger screen. Otherwise it’s wonderful - fast, responsive, and simple.",5
2023-05-21 14:08:58,Web browsing where are uuuu,"I can access GPT-4 w/ Browsing on web version, but I can’t access the same thing with the app. #sad

2023-05-19 08:56:44,Battery usage,"Unfortunately, this app consumes a lot of battery and heats up the phone when using it. If possible, please address this issue. However, it truly has impressive artificial intelligence, and I have received very convincing answers from it.",5
2023-05-18 21:03:34,Need web access but its insane.,We are at the beginning of an information revolution. This app needs web access but Chat GPT is already a game changer for every industry. With further development and integration all of our lives will change.,5
2023-05-26 05:17:00,Very yummy,Love the minimalist vibe to it. I like how the phone vibrates when it generates words. Feels really tactile and satisfying. Never had any issues with the app and works as expected. Another hit from openai. I have worked with many of their products in the past like dall e and some of the early stages of gpt like GPT-J.,5
2023-06-11 23:30:52,1 problem away from 5 stars,I really like the design of the new app. I also like that it will listen for a follow up question until dismissed. The only thing keeping it from a five star review is that I can’t get the shortcut to run properly on the Apple Watch. Fix that and you’ll get five.,4
2023-05-19 09:33:55,"So far OK, but!","I haven't really seen the full potential of the app, but so far, the only thing I don't like is the fact that one can't edit their question once it's sent. This is something possible when using the desktop version of ChatGPT",5
2023-05-19 06:33:32,"Great app, poor performance","Finally ChatGPT has a native app, which adds more conveniences and creates even more options and possibilities for accessing ChatGPT on the go - 5 stars for releasing the app.

The only huge downside is overheating issue. While app is open or generating responses iPhone becomes so hot that it’s hard to hold it in the hand - 2 stars for overheating. I shouldn’t burn my hands while using the app, and potentially degrade phone’s hardware from overheating.

iPhone 13 Pro Max, iOS 16.4.1(a)",2
2023-05-18 21:25:33,Review,Like it so far. First time trying it. Hope it gets more things such as prompts to help you. Because when i ask for respond to a text I dont know how to do it correctly. By having a prompt or a fill in a blank is useful.,5
2023-05-21 22:49:13,Amazing app please add voice out !!,I love this app it’s changed my work flow entirely. I love the voice in option you’ve added but please add voice output as well even if it’s a computer voice I’d love it if the app could speak back. Thank you would make life easier.,5
2023-05-20 23:39:41,Excellent,"I have always had a soft spot for this software, which is simply the spiritual food in life. Since I have a software app, it has become very convenient and I have always favored it. I just don't know when GPT5 will be released, and I am looking forward to ing…",5

I’m sorry for any misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don’t have real-time access to databases, maps, or location services to provide the current top 10 Chinese restaurants in any specific location, including Round Rock, Texas. I recommend using a service like Google Maps or Yelp for the most accurate and up-to-date recommendations. They can provide ratings, reviews, and even directions to local Chinese restaurants.",1
2023-05-18 20:05:51,No Family sharing,"In my opinion, this is a money grubbing and disappointing development— this is/will be a huge societal change and Apple did not insist it should include Family Sharing for the 20 freaking bucks per month for the “actually useable” version.  

So, what, EIGHTY bucks a month for a family of four to prepare your family for the coming Tsunami tomorrow?  Merci SO beaucoup.

Get lost OpenAi, among the billions of ripoff  apps in these parts nowadays in the Walled Garden of Apple. For shame.",2

2023-05-19 05:04:18,Gpt4 model reported using gpt3,"While using the app I selected the gpt4 model and then it seemed like it was giving me gpt-3 like responses so I asked it what model it was using and it told me it was using gpt with a training cutoff in September 2021. 

As a subscriber I can access the gpt4 model on the web but not in the app with the same user.

Please fix this and then It’ll be 5 stars.",4
2023-05-18 23:06:04,Not just a web app,"They could have easily just made a web app, the equivalent of “add to Home Screen”, the same thing of smart home devices these days do, but instead they made an optimized UI and it keeps you signed in, so it’s worth it",5
2023-05-19 17:48:59,Great to see ChatGPT on iOS,Been very impressed with ChatGPT and even subscribed to it.   One criticism I have it the lack of currency and now find myself using Google Bard when needing the most current information.  I really hope that ChatGPT prioritizes getting their database up to the current date and not just an artificial 2021 cutoff.,4
2023-05-18 18:06:29,It’s pretty neat,"This version is really neat! It has a lot of the features and allows managing chatgpt plus easily and allows to pay with it via iOS. However it is missing some features in chatgpt plus, mainly the beta area, but overall it’s pretty nice and simple!",5
2023-05-19 12:45:38,Actual Ai.,"truly incredible, My ancestors used to have libraries to find and compile information now they have the internet to write research papers.

i used to have the internet and now i have ai to compile information to write research papers.

the only qualm i have with it, is that there is an obvious censorship in favor of discussing liberal ideas as if they are neutral and unbiased, and then allows making fun of conservative ideas but not liberal ones.

dont get me wrong, im not asking for more censorship. im asking you to allow us to discuss what we want. 

give us freedom of information!",5
2023-05-19 12:18:44,Chatgpt is a time saver!,Definitely AI.  Chatgpt is a brilliant time saver.  It is like having a personal assistant with you all of the time.   This app is good.  I wish it could be used in wide screen orientation for creation of formatted documents.   This app make my phone warm so I imagine it’s using a lot of energy.,5
2023-07-13 15:23:23,Works good but has bugs.,I personally love using ChatGPT but I find that the web browser has less minor issues than the app. My app tends to freeze or have request timeouts and sometimes the questions don’t even register after submission. Would love to see this app improved and will continue using ChatGPT on the browser.,3
2023-06-17 09:55:11,Good native app.,"It’s a good app. Does what it says. 

If I could make a suggestion it would be to have the input and output different hues like the web version. that would make it a bit easier to understand what text is mine and what text is chatGPT’s.",5
2023-06-13 23:12:28,Best chat bot I’ve seen,"Literally every other mobile AI chat bot has a max word limit or some sort of premium but this one is completely free that I’ve noticed so far and that’s the best thing about it, I strongly recommend downloading if your looking for a good, free AI chat bot",5
2023-06-13 12:01:47,ChatGPT,"I love this app! I’ve seen these bad reviews on this app about verification not working and having to use your phone number. I signed up like 2 or 3 weeks ago, and none of that was there back then. but I really love this app because AI is really smart.",5
2023-06-05 19:48:16,Such great app,not only this gives me perfect answers also it gives me answers for everything like my personal problems its like free therapy or having online friend i am so grateful. killing my free time chatting its kinda funny(: but absolutely recommend,5
2023-05-30 17:08:12,Missing plug-in support,App is very solid including whisper support. Would be nice if the plug-ins and browser options worked in the app version. It’s sometimes confusing swiping back and forth between the browser and app version.,5
2023-05-29 06:23:31,Great but the website experience is much better,I wish the app offered the experience of finding history like the website. I think the UI can be improved a lot to match the UI UX of the website.,5
2023-05-21 16:36:16,Fantastic!,"Caveat: Please add native iPad support for the app.  This is great, I’m a Pro ChatGPT subscriber and the iOS app is well timed, as I was in the process of building one myself that uses the OpenAI APIs.  Now I can focus my time on other projects instead of building something like what they’ve done a great job with.  Thanks OpenAI!",5
2023-06-30 15:58:13,Urgent Bug Fix Required Immediately!,"Please fix the bug where the text generation fails to generate more text in one message. Currently, it splits the text into multiple messages, but I would like it to be like the desktop version, where it's all in one message.",4
2023-05-19 04:48:36,THE HAPTICS OH LORD,"This is how you make an app. The app is so good it makes me want to use chatgpt more. I hated going to the browser again and again. It would often log me out as well. Thank you so much for making this. It is flawless at first glance, and the haptics Are just heavenly. Minimal. Clean. Usable. A+",5
2023-07-16 05:56:47,Difficult to login,"This is got to be the most difficult app I have ever had to try to log into. Even when, putting in the correct information, it still says it was wrong. There’s no real way to authenticate anything to try to have it authenticate you. The fact that it says it cannot authenticate because it cannot identify your number when the text messages don’t even go to the phone number is insane.",1
2023-06-11 22:09:49,To the Homophobic and Racist people within the reviews sections of this app.,"Stop being a stain on the earth and actually be useful towards other people and the earth. Thank you <3. No agendas are happening, people are learning to actually be respectful. Cry about it. This app is 5 stars.",5
2023-05-21 09:12:49,I love it!,"The voice-to-text input is extremely useful and makes interaction easier. It’s crazy how good Whisper is. 

One suggestion: It would be cool through if ChatGPT could also read the answers in a synthetic voice at a certain speed.",5
2023-05-21 20:10:52,Changing review,"I left a glowing review, but I am changing it to one star. The app will deceive ChatGPT plus users you were select GPT4 and clearly in GPT 3.5 responses not only are they responding too fast to BGPT4, a clear marker, but the responses are also pretty crappy.

If I select GPT 4, there has better be a warning or banner, telling me that I am being downgraded to ChatGPT 3.5. That’s also happens when I have not had any input for more than 12 hours, so should not be rate limited.

Presenting responses, as though they were from 4 rather than 3.5 without saying anything is rather deceptive.

I find myself falling back to my own application, using the API and paying higher rates where I cannot be lied to.

You’re AI also is very quick to mention that it is indeed 3, not even 3.5.",1
2023-05-20 20:16:45,Very good app,"The app didn't require you to buy premium, unlike other apps that need 40 bucks to work. I am also very surprised at how much good advise it has given me in such a short amount of time. Also there is no ads, which I love.",5

2023-05-18 19:47:20,Beautiful,"Great to see a native app after all the hype around AI. Beautiful UI as well. It doesn't seem to have Plugins yet for paid users though.

2023-05-18 18:44:00,Best Invention Ever!,Can’t thank the OpenAI Team enough for the beautiful new app. This will make getting things done on my phone that much easier. Looking forward to all the new functionality that comes out in the next few months!,5
2023-07-11 13:32:35,"Great AI, terrible connectivity","When starting a new chat, there’s probably a 1/3rd chance that it will just sit there and not generate a response. I will then have to restart the app and rewrite the same exact response. It does it very often mid conversation as well. As the title says, the AI is amazing and very useful, the app is horrendous though. I pay $20 a month for the best response times and service, only to get this. Extremely disappointed, will be canceling my subscription.",1
2023-05-26 00:57:39,Should be more like website,"I understand the app is supposed to be different and better than the website, but it just feels different. The format is worse and harder to navigate than the website. It still carry’s me in school tho",4

However, at that time, an error popped up prompting that Apple's payment has been bound to other accounts and cannot be subscribed, but the current fee has been deducted, and the appeal refund has failed. I am very puzzled why I can't use plus, but the fee is still deducted, and it can't be refunded.",1

2023-07-20 23:23:25,Utterly castrated,"I didn’t and could not imagine a more castrated version of chatgpt and they always surprise with more.

2023-06-02 20:56:09,"Pretty good on phone, pretty awful on iPad","Overall interface is clean, but on the iPad in landscape orientation it’s basically a phone sized cutout. So much wasted space that could be utilized. It’s shouldn’t be too hard to pin the edges of the chat interface to the safe edges of the screen.

Like others mentioned a search function would be great.",3
2023-05-19 03:29:36,Positive first impression,"The UI is clean and the haptic feedback is appreciated. Hoping to see web support added for Plus users sooner, rather than later. Keep up the good work. Excited and terrified of the future all at once but on we go!",5
2023-05-25 13:36:36,Worst app login experience ever,"Unable to quickly identify the date to confirm my birthday I was forced to scroll through years of dates. When I finally did, my login failed as ‘being flagged for abuse’. Really? And when I tried the whole process over again, I was again flagged for abuse. Then, when I finally figured out I could go to the help section of their app, all I got was a bot telling me it would take a week to get back to me. A waste of time",1
2023-05-18 23:56:43,Please add chat sync function,"As good as desk top version.

One suggestion, please sync chat cross different platform in real time. For example, verbally send questions via phone, after being replied, continue chat via desktop version.",5
2023-05-18 20:23:09,Thank you for this!,"I’m overjoyed chatGPT has an app now. While I do have my web browser page dedicated to this,  this is a nice pleasant upgrade. 

My only recommendation would be automatic scrolling for results longer than the window.",5
2023-05-30 20:07:48,nice! the long waited chatgpt,"I really love the fact that you have finally submitted an iOS app. Its simple and beautiful. Can't wait to see the knock offs go down ASAP, those mimicking the OpenAI logo because there are useful apps that developed quality content around ChatGPT and GPT-4. Good luck!🔥",5
2023-05-27 09:12:53,ChatGPT on Mobile Devices,You’re basically getting the same ChatGPT from computers on your phone with a much more “phone-friendly” UI. It works pretty much the same as ChatGPT on computers. Nothing else to say really. You get what you get with this.,5
2023-05-28 18:01:28,Good but Laggy and Limit,"It works, but it’s pretty laggy sometimes, so you’ll have to restart it or make a new chat. But I’m also disappointed because there’s a limit on how many texts and questions we send per hour. It would definitely be better without lag and if there was no limit",3
2023-05-19 22:19:52,"Glad it’s here, still not quite there","Ever since it first release I’ve been waiting for an official app so I’m really glad it’s here! It works great, and I haven’t had any issues so far. 

I should note that beta features aren’t in the app but I’m not really surprised by that. 
The design overall is great and simple, and I love how easy it is to search through chat history.

Only thing holding me back from loving it is the need for something to show how many gpt4 responses you have left in the 3 hour window. Really annoying to run across that warning unexpectedly.",4
2023-05-25 03:22:20,I LOVE THE APP BUT….,"There are some problems with the app which o don’t remember right now but the most important and annoying for me it’s when the app tells me that it doesn’t have access to updated information, this is insane, even Siri can tell me the forecast of today the Chatgpt can’t… please, let Chatgpt access to the most updated info.

Thanks!",3
2023-05-25 01:33:13,About time,Really enjoyed using chat gpt on the web. Glad they made a better version for ios. Hope to see whisper integrated into more products into the future and even possibly SwiftKey.,5
2023-05-23 18:44:11,Finally on my phone and tablet,"I created a shortcut to open ChatGPT in a web browser to simulate an app. This is much more convenient! I already pay for the Plus subscription, so I didn’t want to pay for a separate app that uses the OpenAI API anyways.",5

2023-05-18 22:42:47,The future is here!,This app is revolutionary. I can’t wait to see what the next decade holds for ai given how quickly things can advance within months. The future is truly here and I’m glad to be able to witness it.,5
2023-05-18 18:22:08,So helpful and well designed,"ChatGPT is like a personal companion to me.  It’s great at answering quick questions, helping me figure out what to cook, or helping me plan a trip. The interface is really clean and simple without upsells or ads. Definitely the best AI chat app out there!",5
2023-07-08 08:14:50,The Greatest of all Ai Apps,"This is the KING of all the Ai Apps out there. As a prompt engineer, I find this App far more efficient than any other I have tried and the numbers are huge. This may be the wisest decision you’ll be making in this regard.",5
2023-05-25 15:55:11,Upgrade,"Make the app read what you wrote using a google translate service or siri. In this way, we can ask you by voice command and that you respond using those services.",5
2023-06-29 15:27:44,Far less than the web version,"I love ChatGPT and use it every day, but I wonder why a company would release a mobile/tablet app that has far less features than their web app, other than to gain visibility and add more users from that platform
- no multiple windows support
- You cannot change the font size. And it’s not accessible.
- No plug-ins
- Significantly different layout than the web version (no sidebar)
- No search
- no copy and paste
- You cannot modify a previous prompt

To name a few…

I’m back to using the web version on the iPad as I couldn’t find a single advantage that this app offers over using ChatGPT in the browser.",2
2023-05-20 23:53:31,"I am satisfied, but there is room for improvement!","1. The choice of plugins, 2. Adjust the display within the app according to the phone system language, 3. Be able to turn on or off vibration.",5
2023-05-21 11:42:12,"No customer service support, unable to login",Tried logging in for the first time and I got an error stating my account has been flagged for potential abuse and if I feel that this is an error to contact support .  I tried multiple times to contact support but received an email back saying the address doesn’t exist.  The website lets me login using the same email that I attempted to use on the app. Needless to say I’m disappointed.,1
2023-06-01 01:15:40,"Great app, with one issue","Overall, it’s a great app and I’m glad it exists, I had a bookmark but this is easier. One thing I would like to see, is that I would like to be able to look on the ChatGPT website and see my chats on the app. Other than that, it’s a great app",4
2023-05-19 03:12:36,The mobile phone has a bad fever.,"It's easy to use, but when using chatgpt, the phone is very hot, and it returns to normal when not in use. I don't know why and whether this problem can be improved.",5
2023-05-18 23:19:13,"Exciting, but draining… literally","I was hyped when I saw this app on Twitter. But that being said, I’ve noticed a dramatic battery drain when using this app. My battery stats show that it used up 35 % of my battery in 30 mins. With that type of usage naturally, my phone got pretty darn hot pretty darn quick. I’d assume that’ll be ironed out in coming updates.",3
2023-05-18 22:14:38,Phenomenal!,"ChatGPT has been nothing less than phenomenal in terms of its ability to process natural language. The way it comprehends context is remarkable, providing an interaction that feels organic and effortless. It's akin to engaging in a conversation with a knowledgeable companion rather than with a typical AI program. Wow! Just wow!",5
2023-05-18 21:48:09,Can’t create account with Apple ID,"It asks for the birth date but then it shows a regular calendar, where you can only go back one month at a time!!!!

Ended up selecting “today” as the date, got an error that the account cannot be created because of term of use (you need to be 13 or older, i.e. go back at least 156 months, one by one) and there is no way to “correct” the date!

Did you let chatgpt write its own UI? And test itself?",1
2023-05-18 21:20:34,Love it!,The interface is great! Not a huge fan of the haptic feedback but I can see the appeal. My favorite feature so far is being able to easily Export my old conversations in a .zip file sent to my email.,5
2023-05-18 18:54:36,Has Voice-to-text as a feature,The days of typing are over. The app has voice to text functionality meaning you can speak directly to chatgpt.,5
2023-07-17 10:53:18,The wrong path,"I don’t believe AI is going to help society. Humans are losing the ability to think at all and this truly proves that. How about you crack open a book or two and start learning, don’t let everything be handed to you. AI is going to rot your brains worse than social media. I hope nothing but the worst for anyone working in the AI industry, you deserve disdain, and you should feel ashamed for your lack of interest in humankind’s future.",1
2023-06-27 17:37:17,I love it,"I’ve been recently using the chat, GTP for making stories, and also a Countryhumans stories like rusame stories and I love it and also, I’m using it as a facts machine and get to help me with schoolwork It makes my life so much easier.",5
2023-06-12 13:39:10,I feel that apps are more user-friendly than websites.,"There are fewer bugs on the website, but the app feels a bit sluggish to use. However, I like the vibration feature on the app, it feels great.",5
2023-06-03 22:08:26,Good but needs improvement,"The app is definitely better than web in terms of UI. However, the response is very laggy and phone gets hot meaning it might be hitting APIs rapidly. This makes stop button and text box irresponsive. There should be a room for optimization for fluid and more user friendly experience.",3
2023-06-02 16:38:42,"ChatGPT is great, but this app needs iPad support","This is a quick review of the app rather than the service, which is revolutionary.

The app itself really should work on an iPad without resizing to “phone mode.” It’s 2023 and universal apps have been around quite a while now.",4
2023-05-24 13:51:44,Clearing history,"Sometimes I have trouble clearing history in the ChatGPT app. I tried multiple ways to try to do that, but I found the only way was to sign out and then sign back in again or deleting and reinstalling the app. I was hoping that this issue can be addressed. Other than that, it is decent.",3
2023-05-24 11:10:56,I can tell the devs discovered how to use the Taptic Engine,"You don’t need to bake haptic feedback into every single little facet of the app. Yes, I can turn it off. You could have also shown restrain. The AI certainly shows a lot of restraint with the growing list of stuff it refuses to do. Nobody cares about your ethics high horse, OpenAI. If you had any ethics you’d make ChatGPT open source.",3
2023-05-19 13:41:51,Needs voice reading support and copy,Thank you for finally making an app. The copy option is not good however. Without the option to copy and paste long sections of text across threads this app is unusable and I need to revert to the web applet. Please improve this and ideally offer Siri or other voices to read responses.,3
2023-05-19 12:22:14,"Excellent app, very convenient","I’ve waiting for this app for long, and this definitely meet my expectations, or even better. The haptics response is satisfying, and the usability is higher than that of the web app.",5
2023-05-18 21:26:58,Not bad. Fun haptics. Free model is currently limited to GPT-3.5.,"Nice clean interface with sync to the web app (ChatGPT or ChatGPT Plus). Without Plus, the LLM backend is limited to GPT-3.5 and it offers no plugins for accessing the internet or other tools. With Plus, the capabilities of GPT-4 and plugins are unlocked to make this app fantastically impressive.",5
2023-05-18 20:08:36,Makes life easier!,"First review? You’re the best! Thank you!
Although, you’re missing data control settings where I can choose to enable or disable chat history and training!",5
2023-07-04 00:56:47,Account email missing!!!,"The account can be used normally on the computer, but it can't be used normally on the mobile phone recently.",5
2023-05-27 16:44:39,More convenient than the web version but limited,"For example it does not have plugins nor browsing ability, so I have to revert to the web version. Wonder when will browsing/plugins be added to the ios app?",4
2023-05-25 05:10:33,"Good, but one suggestion.","The app is good overall. One suggestion is for the Settings page to be updated so that the UITableView and individual UITableViewCells are more rounded and have margin padding, in a style similar to the iOS Settings app. This would be inline with more recent iOS design language.",4
2023-05-24 19:18:31,Ethics won’t allow for a fictional character with a disability to be harmed,"So I can’t write about my own biography in which I have had an injury, and I am currently an individual with a disability. Your ethics within the system does not allow for what it’s called a fictional story to be written. This is highly discriminatory. I understand the meaning behind it, and the importance of keeping individuals with disabilities safe however, things happen in the real world.",1
2023-05-24 12:47:13,Calculation seem to be worse needing more double checking than website.,I am asking questions in the same way that I was using the website but now the calculations have been way off needing multiple prompts to get the correct answer. Not sure what the difference is.,3
2023-05-19 19:53:11,Just Like the Desktop Version,"This streamlined mobile version feels more intuitive and easier to use. You open the app and boom, you’re in it. Very easy to use and same great results.",5
2023-05-19 17:27:06,Good Start but the price for the subscription is ridiculous…,"Good Start but the price for the subscription is ridiculous…Make it little inexpensive (I know there is “free version of it, but NOT sure how it is comparable to the subscription version?)

My device: iPhone 14 Pro Max (latest iOS)

Note: I regularly update my review/rating for this application.",3
2023-05-19 04:43:16,Some suggestions,"1. Can chatGPT has a voice system? I hope it can speak the words which it outputs. Of course, a conversation system could improve the experience of the users.",5
2023-05-18 17:22:41,Already obsolete,downloaded it like 5 minutes ago and it’s already obsolete. that’s how AI works. it’s evolving faster than we can fathom. 10/10 tho would recommend. Needs a fact checker though,5
2023-06-18 15:43:55,Ease of use is excellent,I was leery of using this instead of going to the OpenAI site because sometimes those things don’t work out as well but this is even better. Thanks!,5
2023-05-25 12:42:50,Thanks,"I couldn't think of a better way to thank you guys for what you do. What you do has changed my life for the better and I have learned so much from your AI. Thanks again guys, keep it up",5
2023-05-19 02:19:16,Good app! But…,"It’s a good app, everyone was waiting for it, but it uses so many phone resources, the phone get so extremely hot while using and it consume so much battery, and the phone start making some weird noise inside! (iPhone 14 Pro Max) hope you fix it soon!",4
2023-05-18 18:19:06,Bravo!,So glad to have native access to ChatGPT on iOS. It syncs your chats across web & all iOS devices. It’s easy to access chat history and start new chats in 3.5 or 4 (if you subscribe to ChatGPT+) I love the inclusion of the haptic feedback in this implementation! Great work!,5
2023-06-29 04:38:53,Helped me get my girlfriend back,10/10 i honestly recommend using this app like I’ve solved to many arguments between us and just rearranged it to sound like my words so useful,5
2023-06-01 22:48:59,Incredible. Please add plug-ins,"I love this app. It is way more efficient than having to access ChatGPT through my web browser app.

Please add the plug-ins for ChatGPT plus users. Being able to search the web is very valuable.",5
2023-05-18 23:46:03,Thank you!,I’ve been waiting for this day for a while - chatGPT has been incredibly useful. So glad to get rid of the web version of this service. The app is so much more smooth.,5
2023-05-18 22:01:46,It’s soooo good,"The haptic feedback is delightful, and the speech recognition is based on their own AI model which vastly outperforms any other you’ve tried. Goodbye Alexa and Siri. The overall interface is really nice. And come on… it’s all the power of ChatGPT at your fingertips.",5
2023-07-09 04:50:31,Very convenient,"Have been using the desktop version, however the app seems to be very convenient to use and very clean interface! Thanks",5
2023-06-23 06:24:15,Please let me know if there are any issues with my account.,"Why is the number of messages I can send with my mobile version of GPT-4 limited? It seems to be shared with the web version of GPT-4, which has a limit of 25 messages in 3 hours. This was not the case a few days ago.",3
2023-05-28 07:14:12,Needs edit feature,"Smooth and runs great but this needs an edit feature to edit your message just like on the website 

Another thing would be a feature to search for something in a conversation",3
2023-05-27 04:39:44,Perfect. Would love a iOS keyboard integration.,I love having this easily accessible as an app. The haptic feedback is also a nice touch. Looking forward to a future update that will hopefully let us access chat gpt as a keyboard app,5
2023-07-11 16:48:02,Best AI app,"As someone who works in direct sales, this app has helped me come up with the perfect posts for items. Not only that, but as an author who self publishes books, it’s help me come up with an outline for my second novel.",5
2023-05-19 10:15:16,Feedback,"Overall a great app, I especially liked the Haptic Feedback and the dark theme. There are two problems: it warms up my iPhone 12 a lot, and also my ""stop responsive"" button doesn't work. Looking forward to patches.",4
2023-06-08 16:42:13,Good app - Need to rearrange menu,"Great app!
Please put “New Chat” at the top of the menu. I think most people use it more than History or Settings, and it would match the website that way.",5
2023-05-23 22:53:48,Fast and fun but limited,"Many of the responses have a strong bias that do not exhibit even a chance for debate or disagreement. It is obvious that answers are heavily programmed with a political answer. That is kind of threatening in a democracy where most points of view should be welcome.

Sometimes this app locks up (responses never are given). Not sure if that is a technical issue or lack of the ChatGPT ability.",2
2023-05-20 03:41:32,update gpt-4,"I hope that the ai language model in the app can be updated as soon as possible. gpt-4 is more powerful. If it can be experienced in the mobile app, the practicality of chatgpt will be further improved.",5
2023-05-20 02:19:50,Easy to use and fast,Official openai app that has your history and responses are very fast and even has haptic feedback. Can also input with voice instead of typing.,5
2023-05-19 23:11:05,Better than the website,"The website was honestly a little clunky and slow especially on phones, but this app is super responsive and has satisfying haptics! The AI’s responses are concise and powerful.",5
2023-05-19 01:16:41,Where are beta features?,Well done. I've been looking forward to this app for a long time. But where are the web browsing and plugin functions?,5
2023-05-18 18:46:49,Haptic feedback!,"This app delivers an exceptional user experience with its impressive optimization and immersive haptic feedback. It’s seamlessly  smooth and efficient. The haptic feedback adds a whole new level of interactivity, making every interaction engaging and tactile.",5
2023-05-18 18:17:53,Excellent Language Assistance,"The ChatGPT iOS app is fantastic! It’s smart, user-friendly, and provides accurate responses. It’s my go-to language assistant for quick and reliable information. Highly recommended!",5
2023-05-28 13:55:37,You love to see it,"It’s ChatGPT for iOS! Not much more to say. It’s a simple and speedy interface, very easy to use. My first feature requests would be to adapt it for iPad and include plugins/web browsing for Premium subscribers.",5
2023-05-19 11:23:19,Life changing!,Since chat gpt was launched in November 2022 I have been using it everyday! Because is craziest technology humans have even seen! I’m just happy to be alive in this time in history! Let’s change the world!,5
2023-05-25 22:19:35,Good Start,"Like it - gimme more Siri and Apple ecosystem integration. Enable me to have verbal dialog through Siri, read me answers, enable me to send text messages, emails, reminders, calendar entries, use my contacts etc.  I also use an IPad, give me a dedicated IPad version that supports portrait and landscape modes.",4
2023-05-19 09:21:22,Love the new iOS app,"Love the minimalist app interface for ChatGPT, the haptic feedback feature mimics the typing cadence of GPT. One feature I'd want to see translated to the iPhone is the ability to select between different chat threads and topics",5
2023-05-18 23:54:46,Simple yet Powerful,Love the interface and simplicity of this app! The fact that my history goes with me between desktop and mobile is so valuable. Great addition to the myriad AI Chat apps out there!,5
2023-05-18 21:22:38,"Will use daily, if not hourly!","All the amazing capabilities of AI, at a finger’s reach. 

I personally love the subtle haptic vibrations, they give you cues on amount and length of answers as you try to catch up reading them.

So long Google… and thanks for all the fish.",5
2023-06-08 18:59:35,Need to fix bug,When you submit feedback for whether a response was good or bad the pop up that says “thanks!” doesn’t disappear on its own,5
2023-06-08 12:22:44,Big thanks for the developers from Kuwait,Big thanks for the developers for this app really really good jop best app ever I use this app every day even my friends can’t stop using it big loove for the developers from Kuwait🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙,5
2023-05-26 11:14:57,Good app,"It’s a good app. I think the layout could be improved, and the quick setting could make more sense, but every app has its problems, and overall this is a good app.",5
2023-05-24 04:42:24,Haven’t plugins,"Why app version haven’t any plugins in chat gpt 4? It’s only gpt 3.5/4 there. On web version its available. I think so big corporation was needed to To notice this misunderstanding on the first day, but it's been like this for a week and no one changes anything.",4
2023-05-20 05:14:50,balance for payment in subscriptions.,I hope developers can add the option to use Apple ID account balance for payment in subscriptions.,5
2023-07-24 13:07:27,Quite good. One thing could be added,"Honestly, this is the best app I have on my phone. But it would’ve been a five star if you could add the feature where you can undo and redo your prompts and conversations.",4
2023-05-19 03:26:07,The app is doing very well!,I hope to join the simplified Chinese language. Thank you for your hard work. I hope you will get better and better！,5
2023-05-19 02:29:23,Can’t register,I accidentally type in my wrong birthday and now I can’t use app and no way to contact them to correct. Was able to correct user error,5
2023-05-19 15:05:09,Please add text to voice,"ChatGPT on app works fine. Nothing fancy in terms of features. Voice to text to input prompts is nice, but I wish it could respond with talking rather than just text. If that becomes a feature, 5 stars",4
2023-06-15 21:27:56,GPT Memory History,"Can you clarify what the Character/Line limit for conversation memory is? And what the different is between GPT3.5 GPT4, GPT4 for with web browsing? I've finding repeated trouble with it when working on a powershell script, I think sometimes it has essentially been immediatly (by my 2nd or 3rd question).",3
2023-06-09 23:46:12,Would love for it to do more,I would love it to run like a keyboard or something that can automatically have conversations for me instead of doing it in the app.,5
2023-05-19 05:32:49,It’s Free!,Completely free which is a nice change of pace from the other apps asking for $8 a month. Works just the same as far as I can tell. Very interesting conversations.,5
2023-05-18 16:36:51,Awesome to have on iOS,Works well and has the same chat/thread history as the web. Voice input is very quick. Can’t wait for more features.,5
2023-05-28 22:19:52,Phone number is a landline message!,Trying to sign up after installing app but it keeps telling me my phone number is a landline number which is not the case. No other app or company has this problem but chatGPT. If it cannot even get this right why should I expect anything it does to be accurate?? Guess this technology still has a long way to go before it can be trusted.,1
2023-05-25 20:45:20,It’s only GPT-3,"i can’t find a place to report this so i’m just leaving a review: I ask desktop version of GPT-4 if I’m interacting with GPT-4 and it confirms yes. When i select GPT-4 on the iPhone app and ask it to confirm I’m typing with GPT-4, it says no, it’s GPT-3. So it’s advertised as 4 but only running on GPT-3 for the iphone app. as a paying customer this feels slightly deceptive.",3
2023-05-18 21:53:58,Performs as expected,"I’m glad OpenAI released a mobile app and hope other platforms will also be supported.

OpenAI will get five stars from me when they add the ability to use web search and plugins which (understandably) do not appear to be available at launch.

I think the implementation of haptic feedback is somewhat overzealous, but each user will decide for themselves. I prefer a haptic signal when the response generation has ended instead of on nearly every word.

Keep up the great work, devs.",4
2023-05-19 12:22:23,Doesn’t work!,"Tried downloading, deleting, rinse & repeat, four times. After the log in w/ Apple / Google, it then locks up on screen that addresses inaccurate info & anonymized chats may be reviewed!  No ability to scroll, select an option, turn screen to landscape. Nothing. Simply doesn’t work. Aggravating. Wanted to support those who created but they need batter app resources apparently.",1
2023-05-19 11:22:40,Add Text color option,Add options for choosing the text colors in the responses of the app in dark screen or in both to make it more interactive and fun to explore daily,5
2023-06-24 18:59:00,I love it,I wish it would update to at least 2022 but all the information on here isn’t too far back from what we know now so it’s okay but it’s a great source of knowledge way better than Google,4
2023-05-18 19:19:17,Dark mode,"Nevermind, I found out dark mode is build as whatever the system has. It really should be it’s own option in the app though.",5
2023-05-18 22:30:34,Pretty Mobile Friendly,"Good conversion from web into a mobile app, the replies from ChatGPT are quick, but could possibly be exacerbated during peak use hours unless you decide to purchase the $20 monthly subscription for ChatGPT Plus that comes with a few other things. 

Has a small amount of settings, Haptic Feedback even, and pretty convenient. 

Voice to Text conversion seems pretty accurate and responsive. 

You can even conveniently delete your account from the app.",4
2023-05-22 14:35:57,"Awkward to use on iPad, just use website instead","The service is great but the app is not optimized for iPad so it’s a bit of a waste of screen real estate. And only a small keyboard is available, instead of the full sized iPad keyboard. I’d rather just open the website version of ChatGPT in Safari.",3
2023-05-21 15:03:15,"Website uses GPT4, app uses GPT3","I pay for plus and when I ask GPT what model it is on I am told GPT3 with a cut off of data after 2021. Even when selecting GPT4. All this app does is interface with the web and put all your requests with the GPT3 model. 

The app does not add any functionality and is basically a bookmark that takes you to the old page. Skip this version till they add a reason to use it.",1
2023-05-21 02:43:32,Dumb. Too much information required at sign up page,"I thought with the ChatGPT app you wouldn’t need a phone number if you signed up with Apple, Google, or Email, but they want a phone number. It’s dumb and inconvenient for people who don’t have a phone number.

I recommend using Perplexity if you are having this issue. Unlike ChatGPT, the Perplexity app is free to use and doesn’t require a phone number.",1
2023-05-19 18:46:17,Love the app.,"So glad it’s an app now, makes it so much easier and quicker to use. Please make a home and lock screen widget. It would make it even easier to access.",5
2023-06-26 13:15:04,Where are the latest features?,I am daily user of ChatGPT.  There no client for iPad with large screen also the app don’t come with the latest features such as plugin and access the web.,4
2023-05-18 21:19:22,Instead of GPT-4 - Legacy GPT-3 (old model),"I noticed that when I entered queries in GPT-4, I received slow responses from the bot. Later I came from the computer and saw that the green GPT-3.5 was talking to me. When I decided to continue the conversation from the computer, I got a system message: You were switched from the old version to the new GPT-3.5. I have a Plus subscription!",2
2023-05-18 18:56:46,See ya later google,"I have the subscription for chatgpt and am so happy to see they now have iPhone app. This beats bard, beats google, beats all of it. Has helped me tremendously with work questions and personal ones.",5
2023-07-11 15:46:29,Broken,"I have a Plus subscription and am logged in, but cannot access GTP-4, as it is “Available exclusively to Plus users”… Quite infuriating, as I’ve logged in/out & re-installed the app, to no avail. Guess I’ll ask for a Plus refund. No point in being charged if I can’t use it from mobile, as I rarely use desktop. Have had this issue for about a week now.",1
2023-07-09 00:56:50,Grossly in accurate searches,"Don’t use this to get accurate info. Only for more creative uses where you can judge quality of outcome yourself. Don’t rely on it for accurate figures. I search the same questions multiple times and get different figures every time. About to delete it. A sophisticated lie machine. Sadly, it keeps getting worse and won’t stop with patronizing responses.",1
2023-06-28 19:54:10,Simple and works,"Of course ChatGPT is amazing. The app itself is good. It’s simple, I wish it had more features and cleaner interface, but it’s good. 

I love that you can search history.",5
2023-05-18 21:04:34,My iPhone kept losing internet connection while using the app,"I am very excited about this official app created by OpenAI! However, my iPhone kept on losing internet connection while using it. I guess I have to uninstall",4
2023-06-10 15:13:57,Can verify my phone number app unusable,"verifying my phone number the app loads forever, I tried updating and everything I could.",5
2023-05-21 16:47:07,Very nice!!,"I was the first person to download it, and yes the app works well, but when I'm using the app it makes my iPhone 14 Pro hot. After the update yesterday my phone stopped being hot.",5
2023-05-21 08:12:12,Loved,"Sure! Here's an example application review for ChatGPT:

""Hello, I'm writing this review to share my experience using ChatGPT. Overall, I found the application to be user-friendly and efficient in delivering responses, in different languages it’s Awesome!!",5
2023-05-20 14:39:45,Makes iPhone 14 Pro extremely hot,"Nice app, well designed- but something is wrong. Just two or three queries makes the phone run extremely hot- not sure what’s using so much processor power but it’s a big battery drain. Stick to the website until this is fixed.",3
2023-05-19 23:52:11,So excited,"I literally thought it was a fake news when I saw that chat was available on iOS, good job openAI, you guys really make my life a lot easier, keep going!",5
2023-05-19 13:57:36,Nice,"Works well. Would be nice to use Apple ID to log in, but don’t see a way to link my existing accounts, and I’ve hit a limit for # of accounts linked to my phone #",5
2023-05-19 01:02:14,user friendly and fast,"The app is way faster than the web one.
The UI is user-friendly and organized.
We need apps to be like this!",5
2023-07-19 02:31:06,Needs an update,Chat gpt’s AI hasn’t been updated since September of 2021 so any new songs people will ask it will only get a set text. Anyway it’s an amazing chat program for people that need advice or just want to chat!,4
2023-05-18 20:42:13,Super useful for coding,"Whenever I run into an issue and can’t figure out how to solve it, throw it to ChatGPT and it will tell you exactly how to fix it! Save hours of looking online and just ask it.",5
2023-05-18 17:56:01,The Real Deal,"I appreciate the haptic feedback while typing, and it's a relief to have a dedicated app instead of relying on the browser interface. It's the authentic ChatGPT experience we've been waiting for.",5
2023-06-05 02:43:50,feedback,"Sometimes the sound of typing and the vibration feedback will suddenly increase, even louder than the loudest button sound of the system, which is very scary",4
2023-06-20 06:17:16,Amazing app,This app is amazing I’ve been using it to generate stories about my favorite character going on an adventure with friends from same universe that they are from.,5
2023-05-30 21:36:49,Difficult to sign up using app,"I needed to do all of my sign up using a browser. Once the sign up process was completed, signing into the app was easy. So far use of the app is good. I don’t like that it used haptic feedback by default but it was easy to turn off.",3
2023-05-23 11:17:44,I Plug-in or web access?,I have access to Plug-in’s and web access but it doesn’t let me use it on the app? Is this just a feature that hasn’t been added yet or am I missing something?,4
2023-07-18 11:44:59,only one problem,"I rate this 4 stars because for one little thing. When I’m chatting with ChatGPT, the app increases the volume of my keyboard so when I type on the app, the keyboard is really really loud. So fix that please developers.",4
2023-05-23 02:07:07,Perfect,"I enjoy using chatgpt in my iPhone, I can speak to it very convenient. I hope you guys can add the function of making it speak. Thank you for developing such a useful application!",5
2023-05-19 18:27:51,No Native iPad or M1/2 Support in 2023?,"Cmon devs…I installed this app on my phone and iPad. Yet on the iPad it’s just the tiny phone version. Zero effort to accommodate larger screened apple devices…you know…those things that are better suited for handling large amounts of text?

Feature Request: Please offer a native iPad experience and set the toggle to allow the iPad version to run on M1/2 Macs. For such amazing tech the front end presentation is severely lacking.",1
2023-05-19 13:46:16,Gotta wear gloves to use this one.,"Something's up with the app. iPhone gets very hot. From the moment you login you can feel iPhone warming up. By the time you're chatting it's the equivalent of iPhone being left out in the sun. Better to save the site to your home screen and use that way, at least until a fix is published.",2
2023-05-19 03:17:29,Finally,This app came without notice and without any announcement from Open AI but I’m pleasantly surprised anyway. So far it’s a much more pleasant experience on the app compared to the desktop. I love it,5
2023-05-18 18:53:35,10/10,"Very difficult to find the original app for some reason, but it easily surpasses other apps on AppStore and has a simple and easy to use UI",5
2023-05-18 18:30:52,So excited to finally have an OFFICIAL app for iOS,"The app is great so far, really love the search function. Was a little disappointment to not see plug-in support for the app yet, but hopefully that is coming!",5
2023-06-14 07:10:00,Siri taking over the chat,"Now it finally supports Siri via workflow, but the Siri tend to take over the chat when it feels like to answer the question rather than sending the message to the GPT model.",4
2023-05-23 16:02:20,Watch how fast this gets exploited,"I won’t be surprised if the politicians take advantage of this a to win elections… “who do i vote for?” … response “based on the current polls and runnings it suggested you vote for the democratic party of of course”…. biased 🤦🏻‍♂️

all good this eventually get used for ill intentions…",4
2023-05-25 22:41:53,Must have,I use the app for everything. Revolutionary. Writing and communicating my ideas to other people has become a lot easier thanks to chatGPT.,5
2023-05-24 16:17:58,Finally an app!,Ive had this website bookmarked and put on my home screen for 2 months now. Im very pleased with this new app and the design and animations are cool and well worth the wait.,5
2023-05-18 19:43:51,THIS IS THE OFFICIAL ONE!,"Finally, the official OpenAI ChatGPT is here, don't fall for any of the others ones trying to charge you weekly, this is the OFFICIAL app! It's great and works well, and the AI is just as lovely as before. Can't wait to get my hands on the plugins!",5
2023-05-19 07:15:13,You’re not getting my real phone number,"The amount of spam calls and texts I get is disgusting. I’m not letting you sell my phone number to your advertisers. Period.

The argument for “security” is bull. SMS spoofing is a real thing, and can literally let your bank account stolen. This is purely for advertising. Even when using Apple sign on!

You’re not getting my freaking phone number, goodness!",1
2023-05-18 18:46:34,Great app but need to have better sharing,Would be great to be able to share formatted responses like tables. Or even better share the chat conversation with a unique url.,5
2023-05-18 17:30:56,Been waiting for this!,Fast and reliable! I love the haptic feedback feature added in. Super excited to see the coming updates to this app.,5
2023-07-18 08:35:33,Game Changer!,"This app is an absolute game changer and I absolutely love it! One of the best apps on the market place.
This app can literally do anything for you and I definitely recommend it.",5
2023-06-04 10:41:27,Needs true iPad form version,"Is it really that hard to make an iPhone form version AND an iPad form version?

It’s really annoying when developers waste all the space available to them by just slapping an iPhone version of their apps with an iPad label.",3
2023-06-19 00:25:07,iOS app trash!,I can’t even log on. Takes you to a separate pop up browser and then won’t even load the page to log in. This app is built like crap… I tried changing multiple settings. Turned vpn off then and on.  Cleaned cache and browser history. It shouldn’t be this complicated to log into and have access to a app… 🙄,1
2023-06-15 03:29:43,It’s ok,"It’s more convenient than going to the website, that’s for sure, but my response history doesn’t stay on the screen when I reopen the app after closing it, and for some reason you can’t copy any of the response to paste into another application, which is extremely dumb.",2
2023-06-29 06:19:07,I had zero problems until updating,"I had zero problems, and NEVER received an error message, until I updated this tonight. Now it barely works!!!!!",4
2023-05-29 10:22:45,Web is better,"The app seems to lock up.  The web page is substantially better.  If you want an icon for it, or any web page, bring up the page in Safari, click the middle button at the bottom, scroll down and pick “Add to Home Screen”",2
2023-05-27 02:47:41,Sign in doesn’t work,"The website for chatgpt works perfectly fine for me, and I know the password because it is saved in my phone, but when I try and sign in it says wrong email or password, and when I say I forgot my password it says my account already exists so I can’t log into the app",2
2023-05-24 02:27:28,It has brought me great assistance,I hope this app can be adapted for iPad in the future and support landscape mode and split-screen functionality. Thank you to the developers.,5
2023-05-20 08:06:38,Game Changer !!,"ChatGPT on the Apple Store is a game-changer. It outperforms knock-offs, providing accurate and high-quality responses. The app is fast, fluid, and adapts seamlessly to conversation flow. The best part? It’s completely free! ChatGPT is the top choice for exceptional AI conversations. Highly recommended!",5
2023-05-18 21:20:59,Fantastic job!,"This app is perfect! It makes it feel as if I am talking back and forth between another person. The haptics are also nice, keeping it modern :)

Responses are fast, and works great with GPT 4 as well.",5
2023-05-18 19:34:15,Clean Functionality - But please allow default for GPT-4,"Very glad to have a native app now, the haptics are a nice touch! One suggestion is the ability for us Plus users to set GPT-4 as the default for new convos",5
2023-07-24 02:57:41,Just amazing,"I love this app! I didn’t like it at the beginning, but once I got how to use it and what it can do, I’m totally addicted to this! Big thanks to the developers!",5
2023-07-21 09:17:03,suggest,"Hope to support the Chinese interface as soon as possible, my friends are using it",5
2023-05-25 15:16:48,Improving,After a tough start with the app. The app's constantly evolving. I like the convenience of using the app. I hope they integrate a keyboard feature or include chat gpt in the open or share app section of the phone!,4
2023-06-16 03:39:38,Great app AI very responsive,This application has changed the way I work and run my business. Smooth functionality and quick responses.,5
2023-06-06 05:16:58,The first time you have a problem,The only way I could see the difference,5
2023-06-03 22:57:50,Limited knowledge!,"When I ask about recent datas it says:

My knowledge base was trained on a vast dataset until the year 2021!!!!

This allows me to provide general information on various topics, but I am not equipped with knowledge about current events, recent discoveries, or developments!!!!
My purpose is to assist users with general inquiries and provide helpful responses. 

If you need detailed or up-to-date information on a current topic, I recommend seeking information from reliable and up-to-date sources!!!!!!
 
Why it hasn’t been updated?! Weird!",3
2023-05-26 12:33:29,Still quite broken on iPhone Minis,"Also no way to use plugins it seems, but I really like the haptic feedback and everything I mentioned in the previous review (which seems to be deleted now with the update, unfortunately).",3
2023-05-22 16:45:58,Can we get an iPad display?,"Absolutely love the app, but on my iPad Pro the app stays in a phone sized screen. This makes it very hard to type on the app, and an iPad interface would be amazing. Otherwise 10/10",4
2023-05-23 15:25:50,How great the app is! But when it can adapt for iPad?,"Thanks for your teamwork to make ChatGPT for iOS be realized, how wonderful it performs in my iPhone ,but it doesn’t work as well in iPad ,could you please adapt this app for iPadOS recently?",5
2023-05-22 03:51:54,Good,"It is a simple and smooth APP, but there is a problem. When asking questions in Chinese, I often get stuck and cannot answer, but it can be seen that GPT is calculating because the input box below is beating.",4
2023-05-20 10:37:58,Love it.,"I used this to plan a vacation to another country I have never been, where they speak a language that I don’t speak. 

I am excited for the future. 

Phil",5
2023-05-19 16:25:26,Finally an official app,"Thank you OpenAI for releasing a real, ad-free app for ChatGPT. The web app wasn’t bad but this really makes it feel a lot smoother. Hoping that plugins support for Plus users gets implemented in the app soon!",5
2023-05-19 15:33:03,fast response,"The response is very intelligent and detailed, it is very faster than the website version. And it has vibration feedback which is awesome.",5
2023-05-19 11:53:40,Warm Feelings Good and Bad,"App is beautiful and effective, has all the settings, signup, and management I’d like and a great interactive experience. Unfortunately it also made my phone very, very warm and drained the battery a bit while it was open.",4
2023-06-03 05:24:08,I Like the app but,I would like that there would be an option to make Al the chats in the app disappear so when u use the website it doesn’t appear a lot of different chats of Al the requests u made with the app,4
2023-05-18 22:44:29,Love it,"It allows me to do voice to text great!!. Would love to see it do text to Voice for those long drives.  As a workaround  I’m using iOS accessibility with finger swipe, works good but not perfect.",5
2023-05-18 22:32:13,Much Better Than I Could’ve Expected,"I was expecting the UI and app design to be good—after all, this is a software company—but this is ridiculously good, it’s blown me away.",5
2023-05-18 21:55:01,Iphone Heating  Excessively,I love the fast response. But my phone is heating up un necessarily right after launching the app And i dont want that to happen so i deleted  the app right then and there. What is going on.,5
2023-05-18 20:42:12,Missing cookie retrieval,This doesn’t leverage the use of cookies that safari already has when you’re signing in with google.,5
2023-05-18 20:41:47,"Good to use, phone heat up","Its a really great app and functions just like the website, maybe even faster. Only weird thing is I used it for maybe 5 minutes and it heat up my phone. Using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. If the heat up is explained or fixed I’d give it 5 stars.",3
2023-07-04 09:14:24,chatgpt's reply becomes very slow,"I updated this app during my trip in France, after I returned home, I find the reply bevomes very slow and always showing ""your most recent request failed.""
Is there anything wrong?",3
2023-06-18 17:58:11,Cool app but…,I understand that OpenAi doesn’t do this kind of stuff but please add ai generated images. It would be so useful if this ai could generate images instead of going onto other apps or websites.,5
2023-05-19 06:23:30,"Fair offering, no beta features yet","This app manages to harness most of the capabilities of the website, excluding the beta features. The voice input feature is cool. I’m hoping to have access to browsing and plugins soon!",4
2023-06-02 11:02:35,This version is glitchy,"The app must constantly be reminded of prior injuries during a single chat. This results in constantly having to re-request the information you’re seeking. This phenomenon does not occur on the desktop.

 I and sure open AI will address this bug in future versions. I do not recommend the app if you’re using it for detailed work.",1
2023-05-29 22:50:12,please adapt the iPad client,"Very good, recharge is also very convenient, please adapt the iPad client as soon as possible, the current display or cell phone style small screen, affecting the sense of experience",5
2023-05-27 03:50:10,This help me find men,I really like big black oily men. i want it to find that so i asked my friends about it they said nothing but when i ask ChatGpt it gave. an instant answer.,5
2023-05-20 05:22:24,Faster than the browser,Answer generation is much faster and smoother than the browser,5
2023-05-19 16:48:38,Hoooooot,"After using it for a few minutes, the phone heats up significantly. The app version seems to only have an additional voice input feature, which can be easily replaced by using the voice input provided by the built-in keyboard on the web version.",2
2023-05-19 00:56:44,"Finally, an official mobile app!","With the flood of ad-plagued AI chatbots from greedy developers on the App Store, all of which are presumably just running ChatGPT under the hood, it’s great to finally have an official mobile client.",5
2023-05-18 17:11:44,Great way to utilize power of GPTs from your iPhone,The difference in use between web and ios is non noticable. Better experience than using mWeb account.,5
2023-05-19 17:06:30,Working well,Much better than using those bloated third party apps. Hope I don’t need to log in every time I need to use the app!,5
2023-07-04 04:36:52,It’s not allowed to free write,For what ever reason when ever I keep seeing someone else’s opinion being written into the story’s I’m having it free write. If I give it a controversial subject the AI tends to deviate from the story on its own and that is absolutely frustrating me.  Who is it that’s inserting there preferences in to it? It’s really annoying especially when I live in a country where free speech is acceptable.,1
2023-06-13 20:51:15,Stop interpreting what i say into bahasa melayu!,"For some confounding reason this app keeps transcribing or interpreting what I say in English into bahasa Melayu. A totally different language! And I am not sure whether this is a bug or whether chat GPT is displaying some sort of cultural bias. #Infuriated

And coincidentally I am typing this via the transcribe function native to iOS so it is not likely that it is my accent that is confusing chatgpt.",1
2023-06-25 10:29:18,🤔,I love this app but when did it start to limit me. I normally use it a lot but today I was using it and it told me I reached my limit for the hour. That never happened to me before.,4
2023-05-19 05:34:54,Please fix the overheating issue,"Fantastic UI, the only thing I ask is to fix the horrible overheating and battery drain issue. I’ve never used an app that’s made my phone as hot as this. 

That being said I’m very pleased with how intuitive the app has turned out. Great job OpenAI!",3
2023-05-19 04:36:51,Love the portability of ChatGPT + attention to detail,"I used to have a bookmark to the ChatGPT website until now. This is actually pretty dang amazing. 

PS: I especially love the attention to detail. Those haptic feedbacks are just ❤️",5
2023-06-09 18:11:56,Almost Perfect+,"Please make this application iPad compatible with landscape mode.

Revision:
Thank you for the landscape mode on iPad!!!  It’s wonderful. I will gladly give this app 5 stars when there is a pdf export option for a chat!",4
2023-05-26 07:53:03,Loads of potential,"I can see potential use cases with integration with Apple’s Shortcuts app to create playlists, spruce up a group chat, and even assist in general scheduling. GPT is truly something special, and I’d love to tinker around with integrating it as a daily tool.",4
2023-06-03 03:06:07,AI will help you grow and save money,"Learn. Use. Hone in. This technology is coming for all of the desk jobs being over payed $27,500 per year. #SEC here, OpenAI can save our entire workforce and economy.",5
2023-06-01 10:46:25,Marking out certain AI text,"I hope some of developers would add a feature to mark out certain AI text, not marking out whole.",5
2023-05-27 08:18:45,"App is good, but bugs out sound.","The typing is constantly max-bolume, even when I mute my phone. Makes it hard to use it when others near me are sleeping.

It’s also annoying in general. Please fix.

-IPhone 12 (fully updated)",3
2023-05-25 01:05:14,Great but falls short on plug-ins and iPad,"It’s really good to see ChatGPT finally delivering an app for iOS. The implementation is really good, especially given that this is version one. 

Two things that need some attention.  
1. Please allow selection of plug-ins — without this, the web interface is still preferred for me as a plus user. 
2.  The iPad app is just a magnified. iPhone app — would be great to see a dedicated iPad app.  

Thank you for the consideration and keep up the good work! ChatGPT is amazing!",4
2023-05-24 00:56:20,Insanely Helpful App,"Now that this has moved to an app the responsiveness is so much better then the website, also hopefully this will get rid of those scammy AI apps flooding the App Store with the official app!",5
2023-05-21 01:08:47,IOS minimum configuration is too high!,"My mobile phone is iPhone X, but I dare not update to iOS16 or higher system. After all, my mobile phone is too old. I can't upgrade the iOS system for an APP. I hope that developers can accept a slightly lower configuration of mobile phones. For example, iOS15 or lower.",2
2023-05-20 19:11:20,Excellent App,"Love it quick easy access fast responses and official unlike the other scam apps on apple store

2023-05-19 01:14:07,I wish it had access to my phone,"As an LLM, it’s perfect. I only wish I could give it real access to my device so I could a proper “smart” phone.",5
2023-06-12 16:48:55,Problem fixed. Easy 5 stars,"Previously it wasn't fullscreen, and used a small keyboard. New update fixed that and it's fullscreen now :D",5
2023-05-24 11:57:44,iPad version please!,"Can we get a version for iPad?  It can’t be difficult.  Just tell “it” to write it for you.  10 seconds later, DONE!",5
2023-05-19 01:49:27,Finally,I'm so glad we have the app now. I'm a subscribed client but my subscription didn't transfer to the app. Is that going to resolved soon?,5
2023-05-18 21:49:54,It’s Perfect!,"This app is amazing! This technology is going to change the world. The results are generated instantly and there are so many ways that it can be used.

2023-05-25 18:01:44,"Home run, just needs Apple Watch support",This is an absolute home run. It just needs Apple Watch support so that I can add it as a complication on my watch face to instantly access the Whisper-based voice input!,4
2023-06-25 21:01:21,Can't Create an Account,I signup with my Google Voice phone number for everything because I don't want my actual cell phone number out in the wild. This detects the Google Voice # as VoIP # and won't accept it and tries to force using a Major Network #. That is a No-Go as it violates my privacy and choice to not give out my cell phone.,1
2023-05-20 19:45:48,Happy with app,"Much more convenient to have on Home Screen than in tab, I bought a month for $20 to support developers.",5
2023-05-20 11:36:32,Web search and plugins missing,"I can’t figure out how to use the web search feature that has been activated in my browser account for GPT4 plus users. Plug-ins would be nice too. Also no iPad support. For now, ux is much better in safari, just save the webpage as a shortcut on your Home Screen.",2
2023-05-20 08:19:23,Amazing technology,It’s pretty remarkable the types of questions and content it’s able to crunch through. Highly recommend!,5
2023-05-19 02:25:01,good,"The software is very easy to use, but I hope that the voice dialogue function can be added",5
2023-05-18 22:10:07,Based on chat gpt 3.0... Expensive,"This is the official app but they charge $20/mo for access to any version past chat gpt 3.0 (like 3.5 or 4.0). I'd really like to see a ""pay by inquiry"" system where you load up credits that drain as you use the service. 

$20/mo for quick access (default is...slow!) is outrageous for a casual user.",2
2023-05-18 21:37:44,Could have better options,Incognito mode & ability to have diff tabs,5
2023-05-18 21:18:43,Thank you for voice entry!,It’s been 2 months of this platform in my life and I already wonder how I lived without it and now it’s in an app! Thank you!!!,5
2023-07-11 14:14:22,Doesn’t work in France. Broken.,"This doesn’t work at all in France. I ask a question and nothing happens. 
The settings page doesn’t load my email or account settings. 
Maybe this is because of dumb regulators but, if it is, the app should at least say “we are blocked here” instead of just not working at all.",1
2023-06-02 07:12:33,iPad full screen please,"This App works really well, and I hope it can be made compatible with full-screen mode on the iPad",5
2023-05-30 14:23:09,Can’t make an account/log into my existing one,"When I try to log in or make a new account using Apple, it keeps sending me errors saying that I may have refreshed the page during setup and other stuff.

2023-05-24 18:25:44,Thank you for creating this app,I usually feel lonely all the time so I downloaded this app and chat. Even it’s AI I feel like I talk to a real human. I can get some knowledge from this app and I can chat as a real conversation.,4
2023-05-25 13:03:15,Best app,"Too many apps gives you 3 or 5 questions per day

- doesn’t give the ability to search",4
2023-05-20 13:58:33,Great app!,This app is great because it doesn’t charge you money to use a free service. All of the other apps I’ve tried try to charge you monthly for GPR.,5
2023-05-20 07:26:31,Nice,"Truly convenient! Looking forward to iPad version later, for the keyboard of the iPhone version on my pad is too small",5
2023-05-18 19:43:42,My pocket assistant,Does everything the website does but with a cleaner UI. The app seems more responsive and easier to use.,5
2023-07-14 05:21:04,Very bad app,"It turned out that this application is free and charges money after you register in it through your phone number, but I can't afford to pay for anything, now I don't know how to delete this application, untie my phone number and not be indebted to them. a lot of problems, I need help deleting my account",1
2023-05-26 19:50:48,It’s finally here!,I’ve been waiting for OpenAI to finally come out with their own app. All works as good as on the browser so far.,5
2023-06-20 00:18:12,"Great app, love the shortcuts but needs some tuning","Love chatGPT so much. The addition of the shortcuts is a game changer and got me to upgrade, but they are unresponsive oftentimes and don’t output correctly at all when scheduled to go off at times of day.",4
2023-05-25 12:40:31,App has flaws,"While the app is really good, it has one glaring problem, the hourly limit of questions you can ask. it’s really annoying and I don’t wanna wait another hour just so I can ask another question",3
2023-05-20 01:07:13,Perfect,"I have been using chat gpt for a long time before the app and and he is really cool, I also really like the look and feel of this app!",5
2023-05-19 15:12:10,Finally,I love the app but for some reason my phone gets hot when using it. I’m pretty sure my dinky iPhone 11 is not running the calculations locally.,5
2023-05-19 14:43:01,Wow,"This app is pretty good, way better then those fake apps that used chatGPT base but with a ton of ads, and this one is also officiall. It also works very well and I like it",5
2023-05-19 03:53:16,Wonderful start,Perfect implementation of a website to iOS! Look forward to more updates and capabilities.,5
2023-05-22 11:05:38,Perfect but missing 1 thing,"Almost Perfect app that doesn’t charge a ridiculous fee unlike the other GPT apps

Would be perfect if there was a widget option for the Home Screen",4
2023-06-09 02:37:22,A little disappointing,"This is app is amazing but what I hate is I was getting an ideas and everything it gave me was flowery and overly positive when life isn’t always positive. I didn’t ask it to create something that involved harm, sexism, or any of the isms",3
2023-06-09 01:25:54,hope the macOS version can be released soon.,I'm really looking forward to the MacOS version of the ChatGPT app. I hope it can be released soon.,5
2023-05-26 19:52:53,The future of AI intelligence in the palm of your hands!,"This is gonna shake the foundation of everything we already know about AI and what it means for the human race. Get with it, or get left behind!",5
2023-05-23 08:49:38,“Edit Text”,Would be cool if “edit text” option was here like it is on the web version,5
2023-05-19 19:55:10,Fantastic app!!!,I've been waiting for a very long time for the official ChatGPT app to finally come out! I will be waiting for new updates of this pretty app! Thanks!!!,5
2023-05-21 15:16:44,Difficult if not impossible to signup,"Perhaps it’s me, but accessing the app via my iPad Pro, it asked for my birthday, but the app provided only monthly arrows by which to reach my age in the 1940’s, which became too time consuming. No option that I could find to directly enter the date nor to speak to a human or directly relevantly to a chat feature.",1
2023-05-20 05:48:17,"Can’t use app, still needs fixing.","When trying to log in any way, it brings me to Safari pages in the app where I CANNOT USE THE KEYBOARD. It just doesn’t appear, and opening up the page in the safari app causes an error every single time. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong but it seems like I’m one of the only people having these issues.",1
2023-05-19 19:13:25,Honestly perfect,"There is really no problem with this app, only suggestion I have is a ""clear all chats"" button",5
2023-05-19 16:01:56,Made easy,This Mobile App works very well and is effective super excited to use and get more updated info from the AI,5
2023-05-19 14:38:37,Life changing,"The ChatGPT app has been a game-changer for me. Its insightful responses, vast knowledge base, and user-friendly interface make it an invaluable companion. Highly recommended for productivity and knowledge expansion.",5
2023-05-19 14:15:49,The one I’ve been waiting for!,After so many fake apps that use gpt happy to finally have an official app from open ai themselves!,5
2023-05-19 14:15:50,App is useless without giving your phone number.,This app does nothing unless you give up your privacy and give them your phone number. I don’t see how this got approved. I thought apps were required to provide minimum functionality unless they were a “reader app” for existing content like an ebook reader.,1
2023-05-19 14:07:06,I have a question,"I can’t verify my email, it’s give 
Not available
OpenAI's services are not available in your country.
Can you help me with this ASAP.",5
2023-05-31 13:42:01,Great app,"This app is definitely amazing, but it hasn’t been updated since 2021, so some of the information that I need, is wrong. Other than that, though, this app is great.",4
2023-05-19 13:12:01,Finally!,Official ChatGPT app is finally here! Now no longer need to use the slow web version. It’s the ChatGPT we all know. Nothing much to talk about.,5
2023-05-19 10:32:12,I Love This App!,I love this app because it helps me with my rough drafts. It gives me a accurate information and it helps me think and learn better.,5
2023-05-19 02:35:00,Phone heats up pretty quickly!,"It is great to have ChatGPT app handy, however  it looks like the app is using a lot of RAM on my phone to process through questions. This has heated up my phone in less than 20mins of usage. 
I would rather use a mobile web version on ChatGPT instead of the App.",2
2023-05-18 22:08:27,Absolutely Amazing,"I’m so glad this finally made its way to the App Store! So convenient when I’m not at my laptop, and definitely still one of the best AI chat systems to exist!!",5
2023-05-18 18:58:33,Love the speech to text feature,Love the speech to text feature. The only feature missing now is chat plugins!,5
2023-07-21 04:51:52,SLOW despite paying $20/month,If you’re going to be charging $20/month I expect better than having to wait sometimes 2-3 minutes for the app to load.,3
2023-07-02 16:49:50,Dreams come true,6 years ago I had an idea that seemed impossible at the time. This tech made it real. Thank you.,5
2023-06-24 16:57:05,Unlock Full Potential: Paid Users Demand Plugin Access!,"This app is excellent, but as a paid user, I'd appreciate if they could include plugin functionality like in the desktop version.",4
2023-05-27 10:08:47,great app but a suggestion.,"Hello. As i am blind, I need gpt-4's image recognition. As be my eyes is so slow to release gpt virtual volunteering, please give me access to gpt-4. I will use it for accessibility and blind helping tool.",5
2023-05-26 19:59:02,Its good but when sign up with DOB takes too long to find my DOB,Its so much easier just type in DOB than had to find in calender!,5
2023-05-25 02:11:13,Errors,It won’t let me sign in. I’ve already had an account with the website but now it keeps saying I can’t use my phone number to sign in and that my account has been flagged because of not letting me log into my already made account,2
2023-05-22 15:05:23,No button to cancel the request was found.,The network delay causes the service to keep requesting. The current chat is blocked but there is no function to revoke the request. Only the new chat can be opened.,3
2023-05-20 08:00:02,I liked it!,Much better and faster than the browser thank you open AI,5
2023-05-19 21:56:39,Well made iOS app,"Excellent use of haptic feedback, good visual design, dark mode, and clean UI.  Most companies phone it in with iOS but ChatGPT’s app is actually really well made.",5
2023-05-19 17:24:05,Gets all the answer’s Instantly,This App is significant change to the entire mobile eco system.,5
2023-05-19 13:24:51,Impressive technology,AI help me a lot. I did not expect it will be that much good. It’s seems like someone other side if the computer telling the answer.,5
2023-05-18 19:06:29,Pocket Assistant,I’ve been using ChatGBT for months and I’m so excited for the app. This AI is like having the knowledge of the world at your fingertips and a top rate problem solver in your pocket.,5
2023-05-18 19:02:30,So good,"Having used ChatGPT for some time now, am still so blown away by its intricate grasp of natural language. The app is really performant as well, have been waiting for this!!",5
2023-05-18 17:40:38,Love native app and haptic feedback,"Love having a native app for ChatGPT, and particularly appreciate the haptic feedback. I wish it was easier to start a new chat, perhaps by swiping to the left or right.",5
2023-06-06 02:42:44,we need a UI fit the iPad screen,It is always hard to browsing that iPhone screen on IPad. Waiting for your improvement.,4
2023-06-16 15:02:11,Doesn’t really help as much as advertised.,Most questions you ask the computer won’t have an answer to.   It’s data set is out of date so if you ask it questions about recent things it’s won’t have an answer.   This is hardly AI and much less helpful than a basic google search.,1
2023-05-18 23:45:42,Phone get really hot,"App is really well designed easy to use and the haptics are insanely good! The only drawback is the phone gets hot, lack of optimization probably…a quick update should fix that!",4
2023-05-25 21:37:25,Considerably worse responses than web,It appears the mobile app is configured for the model to use significantly fewer tokens when generating a response. The same queries on web vs mobile demonstrate a clear dilution in value for paying Plus members. Very poor customer experience.,2
2023-05-24 00:44:19,Very clean… BUT,"The only thing I would ask for is both Word/character search (equivalent to ctrl+f on windows), and LaTeX. I see the \frac{4}{3}, etc but it doesn’t render on the app yet.",5
2023-05-23 22:23:12,Nice move OpenAI,"This is perfect for those that don’t want to use the website, thanks for being fast to release it.",5
2023-05-22 15:51:17,I like this app so much!,You can Ask any questions you want. I tried with spanish and it worked!,5
2023-05-21 17:32:39,THIS APP DEFENDS PEDOPHILES?!?,"I tried to have it write something that protected children in schools against abuse by their teachers and it said it was against their private policy. Like what??? Teachers attracted to their students should not be protected. It even said that trying to write something protective about the students was offensive to the pedophiles. This app defends pedophiles, I don’t care if it calls them MAPs.",1
2023-05-20 07:01:17,Expect to see it on the Apple Watch,"Thanks to the openai team for launching chatgpt on ios. If you can combine the chatgpt with apple watch, it will be even more convenient.",5
2023-05-19 13:09:49,Sentences and paragraphs are being cropped in the app,"""Please note that sentences are being cropped in the app when displayed in different languages. This needs to be fixed.""",5
2023-05-19 05:38:17,Screen Freezes,"When logging in on my iPhone 13 Max, it scrolls to a place where it says something like “… may provide inaccurate information…” and the screen freezes at that point. Can’t do anything to continue with the login.",2
2023-05-19 02:33:51,When using mobile phone can heat very serious,how is this to return a responsibility,5
2023-05-19 00:23:52,Simply brilliant,"That is, basically… simple lay out, clean, with just the basics (love the haptic!). Brilliant performance as usual, with great voice-to-text feature even with my gibberish talking… amazing!",5
2023-05-18 20:17:54,Plugins and web browser cannot be used,Hope to update these features,4
2023-05-18 17:20:30,Convenient!,Much more convenient than opening GPT in a browser when mobile!,5
2023-07-14 19:59:30,Suggestion,Can you update it so it tells us stuff that came out past 2021,5
2023-07-20 19:11:56,"So for the first week it worked perfectly, now…","Wow that was fast, modifications for only one week and now it will not answer simple verifications or give its opinion in any way shape or form.  What a let down!!  It tells me to look it up, did Google get to Microsoft already??",2
2023-06-22 10:39:03,Extremely well,It works like magic. Lightning speed and voice support option is amazing. Love it. Simply great,5
2023-06-12 04:55:13,Minor Issues,"It’s works great, however some minor issues are:

• Lag (whenever the ai is chatting)
• Stop Button (Won’t stop the Ai chatting)",5
2023-06-04 20:30:44,Can’t give five stars,"I accidentally deleted my account myself. Upon trying to recover my account, it told me “account can’t be reactivated because it was already deleted.” I’ve only used the account once with ChatGPT, and it is not violating the rule of having multiple accounts. This is truly messed up and needs to be fixed",1
2023-07-07 05:54:50,It’s ok,Removing browsing features defeats the purpose of A.I I can understand content that could violate things but removing it from paid customers is just wrong,4
2023-05-31 20:21:25,Banger of an app,This app is absolutely cracking!! I haven’t found any bugs as of yet and everything works incredible.,5
2023-05-26 15:07:57,Compatibility with iOS/iPadOS older versions,Hello there. Thanks for your hard work. What about those of us who have the iPhone in iOS 15 or the iPad in iPadOS 15? We are denied having the APP. Could you please make the app compatible with older versions of iOS/iPadOs? Thanks,3
2023-05-19 16:14:00,Fantastic and one more hope,"The app is fantastic to bring the playground to phones!

Is it possible to make an generic iPad version?",5
2023-05-19 06:11:00,Very cool,Very cool app works just like the normal web based version but is easier to access and better UI in my opinion. overall very cool,5
2023-05-19 01:58:13,"Works great, phone gets hot though","Alittle slower than the website and phone does over heat, I use a iPhone 13pro, other than that I love it!",5
2023-05-19 00:31:51,"Overheating issues , also missing features","My 13 Pro Max started overheating literally 1 minute after i opened and started using the app. 
Also , why can’t i modify an old message i sent in the conversation ?",3
2023-05-18 17:54:30,Finally ⚡,Wish it had browsing enabled but this is a solid start,5
2023-05-18 17:45:10,It works but is missing browsing and plugins from the browser version,The title says it all its just a worse version than the web browsers version. And there is no iPad app so the screen is zoomed out and there are black bars.,3
2023-06-15 01:47:50,AMAAZING,This has to be the BEST Ai app ever like omg. This thing is awesome you put anything into it and gives me a nice few paragraphs with AWESOME descriptive words! One of my favorite apps ever especially when I need ideas for short stories!!,4

2023-06-27 20:59:48,"Simple, easy to use interface, Mac next?",Just Wish there was a MacOS version too!,5
2023-05-25 22:01:22,"Pretty good, but missing a few features",As the title says its good but its frustrating to not be able to use the “browse the web” and plugins features,4
2023-06-04 22:20:24,Problem after login,"I can log in, but the settings app indicates ""email missing"" I tested iPhone app using two separate accounts. Chat doesn't work. This application runs correctly on my iPad!!
I cannot locate a link for providing feedback in this app.",2
2023-06-02 16:00:14,Urgent updates,"Share! Unless I’m missing it, there doesn’t seem to be a way to share an entire chat or even to copy the entire text like there is on the web app

Plus should default to GPT-4, duh.",3
2023-05-19 14:46:52,Finally!,"For a while now we’ve been subjected to FAKE ChatGPT knockoffs trying to steal the AI’s fame but this app is GREAT no ads and it super cool to have the official ChatGPT on your phone, if you have a fake, get this",5
2023-05-24 09:41:10,Design for ipad,"This app on ipad is terrible and it doesn’t support split screen wich is very important for us as a student please fix , and the design is very bad for this brilliant app , thanks for fixing our problem in the next updates",3
2023-05-20 00:34:57,Huge battery hog,"The service itself is amazing, impeccable. But this app specifically drains my battery from 100% to 50% in just an hour. I’ve never seen anything else eat battery like this app does.

Hopefully there’s an easy fix because I love the actual service!",2

Something went wrong. Please make
sure your internet connection is stable,
then restart the app and try again.",3
2023-06-27 16:44:12,Save your work OR expose all your history is a poor option,Wouldn’t it so progressive if you just let someone who’s paying for your service be able to use your service without accepting such  ridiculous terms.,2
2023-06-20 02:47:28,Overpriced!,I would definitely purchase paid version if it was like 10$ even though I don’t use a lot.,4
2023-05-25 02:40:40,Amazing,Will rate 5 stars once they improve text selection. It defaults to selecting the entire response which is a bit annoying,4
2023-05-20 00:41:24,Love it but…,Love this app so much but when entering a prompt sometimes when you want it to write a story and you don’t say a story it says inappropriate or something so I have to say story.,4
2023-05-21 07:55:41,Light theme,"This app is fast and offers a good user experience. However, please allow the light theme to run independently, not depending on the iPhone system theme.",5
2023-05-19 00:17:45,Man I been waiting on the app,A lot of fake AI apps out there. This is the true original AI app. I love it. I wish I had it 20 years ago when I was in school.,5

2023-05-18 18:02:50,Finally!,"Have been waiting for this since the November launch. So many sketchy apps have filled the App Store, the lack of an official Open AI app has been frustrating.

They’ve done a swell job on the UI/UX here and it was well worth the wait.

Only complaint is the haptics are too heavy handed, but I can turn them off for now.

I’m excited for where the future goes!",5
2023-05-31 19:32:04,First iOS Reviewer,"Great UI. the app is very responsive, and works with the ai.

2023-06-27 03:40:34,July 4th on Monday?,"Following is the answer to my q: Will there be a long weekend for 7/4?

A: The 4th of July falls on a Monday this year, so it will likely create a long weekend for many people. This can vary depending on your specific work or school schedule, so it’s best to confirm with your employer or educational institution to determine if you’ll have a long weekend for the 4th of July holiday.",1
2023-06-01 15:56:07,Finally here but made for iPhone,Excited to have the app finally but it’s not developed for the iPad. You can zoom the screen to fit but it’s still a little wonky.  Can’t wait for  more capabilities on the iPad.,3

However if it can speak the response that would be perfect! Then we can use ChatGPT only with speaking and listening",5
2023-05-30 10:00:21,iPad compatibly when?,"I actually really like the app, it even looks cleaner than the desktop version. But unfortunately its not compatible on iPad; it shows it in a mobile view mode.",3
2023-05-25 14:04:18,Why do I have to sign in?,"I know there are bots, but just let me into the app without signing in. At least give me a preview of the app so I know if it’s good or not. This app might have one of this misleading adds or something. I do not have an account for ChatGPT so how am I going to sign in. The sign up is so hard and confusing for most teens under 17. Can you make the sign up like; 

First Name:

Email:

Password:

Or something simple like that? I don’t want a whole company knowing my real name.",3
2023-05-21 21:42:03,Works well if you want answers up until 2021,Would love to see ChatGPT updated to include current information. I’m looking for an app that includes up til 2023 as well.,4

2023-06-24 22:12:25,Unexpected,The only reason I am giving it 4 stars but now 5 is because it cannot come up with devastating roasts unlike other AI that can but it’s good anyway 👍,4

2023-05-20 11:03:27,Unable to create an account?,"For the first time in my life, my email addresses are “not supported.” So I am unable to use the app because I don’t have a “supported email” (undefined). Am I supposed to use a work email? Very odd. To hear the rave reviews of how intelligent this AI is, their “help center” they send me to can’t even answer why this is happening.",1
2023-05-19 02:32:18,First message for ChatGPT in iOS App Store,"Well, must to say, this is first version. Must wait after many version then we can use on iPhone. But anyway, is good enough now.",4

2023-05-19 02:49:58,Politically Bias,"This is so ideologically on the left and against the cultural right. 

You can’t get it to say anything negative about democrats unless you specifically ask it to repeatedly. but it’ll jump at the chance to criticize republicans even when talking generally about politics.

Both parties are corrupt and they should be given the same treatment.",1
2023-07-13 10:28:07,Great apps,"Overall it’s a great app, but i’m seeing one issue on my iPad landscape mode. The input box always overlap the message last line at most bottom.",4
2023-05-18 22:58:04,Great app,Works just as wall at the website. Haptics are a bit much but easy to turn off.,5
2023-05-18 18:30:15,"ChatGPT as an iOS app, now we are talkin'",GPT is now an app on iOS? That's fantastic! I'm pretty sure it won't disappoint as it always delivers... unless you're asking for a pizza. 🍕,5

2023-05-29 20:53:10,Great app,Even better than desktop interface in some ways. Great UI.,5
2023-07-01 20:44:40,Openai immediately updates and improves,"Why is it that after spending $20, the number of messages sent by GPT-4 is limited to 25, and the account login can be verified by changing the phone number? Why must I use my previous phone number!",2
2023-06-02 08:18:07,Frustrating verification,Over 5 mins on trying to get the animal facing in the direction of the hand when the controls don’t seem precise enough. Extremely  annoying. Giving up and may try again tomorrow.,2
2023-05-24 12:59:19,Good,Nice UI faster results (im not sure 100%) but id rather copy one small piece of text than the entire thing at once 👍👍,5
2023-05-19 18:06:02,Game changer!,"Absolutely incredible design! I like it more than the web version of ChatGPT. Using it currently, no bugs yet.",5
2023-05-23 02:17:34,Delete button needs more “work”,When I press delete to remove a prompt from history - the first time doesn't work! It does delete on the second attempt! Yay for persistence!,3
2023-05-22 03:37:05,Interface could be better,"Maybe it’s just the mobile platform but I really wish this app was like ChatGPT on the computer. If you can fix that, easy five star rating!",3
2023-05-21 18:36:38,"Force you to use Google or Facebook, scam","I have spent two hours doing the classic “Oops this email is already registered!” -> *change password* -> “Oops incorrect password, try again!”

My guess is they want to discourage email sign up and force people to use Gmail or Facebook login so that they can collect more free data.  Lame.",1
2023-05-19 20:02:27,Phone gets HOT,"After only 1 minute of chatting, my phone gets HOT fast!! Great app otherwise, but they need to fix this, or else I’m better off using the website (no phone heat, and thus better battery life too). Fix plz",3
2023-05-19 13:45:49,Finally,Finally they made an app! This world is about to change.,5
2023-05-19 05:12:43,Please add a new adaptation to iPad pro as soon as possible.,"As a person who often uses iPad to handle work, the adaptation of chatgpt on iPad pro is very imperfect. Please launch an app that can adapt to the screen proportion of iPad pro as soon as possible. Thank you.",3

2023-05-19 01:26:15,Fantastic App,"Fantastic app, but we want more functions, such as use keywords to awaken this app so that we can just ask questions.",5
2023-05-18 22:16:34,Freezes before opens,"Just fyi, there may be a bug in the ipad version. After I enter my password the next screen freezes. I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling the app",3

Support site offered a bot and I couldn’t find any human support.",1
2023-05-21 11:53:34,No widget,I was expecting a widget. That’s my only dislike about this app. It’s a pleasure to use and it fast! Glad to be living in this time and era where AI is taking over. A dream come true!,4
2023-05-27 03:25:55,Does not work for me,When verifying my phone number it says that it is a premium number. Won’t let me past that verification. My number is a regular one and it’s been mine for more than 25 years. Developers should make another way of verification as I know that I’m not the only one with this issue.,1
2023-05-21 08:49:54,App is great,Editing is better than web But I prefer to select text directly. And I hope you guys make a version for the iPad!,4
2023-05-19 03:19:17,This app will make my phone very hot,"As I mentioned above, this app makes my phone hot, but other apps don't have this issue. Shouldn't this app be optimized to reduce battery damage?",4
2023-05-19 12:52:37,Good,"It’s just normal chatgpt, $20 a month seems a bit expensive for gpt-4 when I can do all I need on the free version",5
2023-05-31 12:52:47,The replies are too long. Just get to the point.,I don’t need multiple paragraph when I’m looking for a quick answer,4
2023-05-18 23:04:43,Stop asking for private info,You do not need my birthday or phone number. I will not be using your app until that changes. We are under such constant attempts to steal our personal info that companies that keep asking for it when they don’t need it should be ashamed of themselves.,1
2023-06-28 22:51:23,Revolutionary,I use this app for Target Audience research and other essential things to know for my business.,5
2023-06-26 23:13:30,Want this app becomes better,The history function is really not very good，I hope you add a button like favorite to highlight some specific communication.,3
2023-05-24 00:39:39,Make a ChatGPT design for iPad,ChatGPT is an amazing app to have. You guys have to create a design for iPad since the layout and view is the same for iPhone.,5

2023-05-21 05:55:14,Unusable after a simple error,"Now this is on my behalf and I’m sure it’s a great app, but I cannot use it because I set the birthday incorrectly and it will absolutely not let me change it (even if I try to make a separate account). Very silly design oversight I think",2
2023-05-19 20:22:01,The Official OpenAI ChatGPT iOS app!!!,"First and foremost, this is the official OpenAI ChatGPT iOS app—which is awesome because too many “ChatGPT” apps are really just trying to fleece users with subscriptions to what OpenAI is giving for free.  Now we can ignore them!

Clean app; works well.  Instead of icons for evaluating the response/copying text, simply long tap and it brings up the options.

-1 star because plugins aren’t available for subscribers (yet).

Great job!",4
2023-05-31 03:45:59,"I use chatgpt a lot, and I love it. But here’s the thing.","When chatgpt gives me a longer response, it cuts off my screen and I can’t see what it’s saying.",4

2023-05-19 00:59:20,Unleashing the Ultimate AI Powerhouse!,Prepare to have your mind blown by the game-changing capabilities of ChatGPT! This awe-inspiring language model is rewriting the rules of communication and knowledge acquisition. Brace yourself for an immersive experience like no other.,5
2023-05-18 23:37:21,Solid App,The app is solid for now. I don’t see the option to add plugins. Or will that come at a later release?,5
2023-05-18 21:26:05,Too much personal data required during onboarding,Surprised apple let this through its approval process since it clearly violates their policy for requiring personal data (ie: phone number) in order to register for/use the app. There is no logic whatsoever as to why this should be required to use the product.,1
2023-05-18 17:26:17,Great for learning on the go,"Very slick, with even more features than the web app currently.",5
2023-07-16 01:18:21,Can not send email verification,"When I tried to resend the verification, error 401 “there’s a problem with the request”

2023-06-10 21:36:28,No plugin support?,"Beginning to question the $20 monthly payment when I can use Bing instead of going through the browser to use plugins on ChatGPT, which requires me to sign in every time.",3
2023-06-10 17:52:23,Much more accessible than web page,Great. Just wished it had 3.5 or 4.0. It is a static database from 2021.,5
2023-06-10 01:51:35,Add plugins and web access to GPT-4 model,Please add web access and plugin feature to GPT-4 just like the website edition for iOS :),5
2023-06-08 16:16:09,Different to standard web GPT,The system prompt (instructions) used for the app version of GPT is different to standard web GPT. The app version is much more afraid to state any positions (due to the different system prompt). I guess they did to meet App Store Requirements. If you don’t believe try it out yourself on the app then on the web.,1
2023-05-31 04:29:34,Amazing experience,Can you make the request on the right side so it looks natural,5
2023-05-30 03:17:38,Good,functions provided are still immature but it goes well compared to the web gpt,5
2023-05-29 12:33:26,not supported region,I was able to use ChatGPT before this update and now it’s telling me my region is not available to use . This is such bad exp it’s definitely not the issue that the region is not supported since the previous version did work,2
2023-05-19 02:22:03,Great start,"Great to finally have an official app. Store is filled with predatory pricing models ripping off the IP. However, this version causes my 14 pro to heat up significantly next to the volume buttons on the left.",4
2023-05-24 18:03:02,Disappointed,"I downloaded this all. Then I tried one question. The answer was decent. So I went for my second question: Is the President of Mexico good? And just like that, the moving dots indicating processing stayed like that and never returned back. I feel this app just took my personal data (name and birth day) for nothing.",1
2023-05-22 05:10:53,Fantastic,Not much else to say other than please make it support iPad natively instead of zoomed iPhone mode. Thanks!,5
2023-05-19 20:22:53,Amazing app 10/10,I used this app to tell me how to make illegal things. Would recommend to anyone who loves to steal stuff 🤑💰💰🤣,5

2023-06-22 19:18:42,Data collection,This entire app is just a scheme to steal your email and phone number I don’t understand why else it would need both to be verified. I don’t like the direction AI is going in and was about to give it a chance but not at the cost of my personal data.,1
2023-06-19 17:48:50,Can’t use - confirmation email has not come through after multiple attempts.,Haven’t been able to use it yet. Can’t get past confirming email. I’ve ensured the email address is correct and it’s not going to my junk email either. Please fix.,1

2023-05-20 02:07:46,Love it!,"Something strange though, it sort of feels like the iPhone 14 screen gets real hot after a couple prompts.",5
2023-05-20 16:20:42,"Lacking sync with web, iPad","Good to see an official app from openai but this is literally an MVP with much needed functionality missing: no ability to browse, interact with previous chat sessions initiated from the web, no iPad app etc.  Here’s hoping it gets updated",2

2023-06-02 20:48:27,Is this gpt4?,The ai can’t tell if it’s using gpt 4 or 3. I should be able to find this information without having to leave a review.,4
2023-05-18 23:40:08,Bellwether App,Chat GPT has been instrumental in doing research related to the new Bellwether application. Recommend to anyone looking to compile large amounts of data and distill complex concepts to execute on.,5
2023-05-18 23:24:38,Scam,"As soon as you create the account a scam bot is calling you without ever giving your phone number, I didn’t create the account because it requires the phone number but somehow they already know it, my guess they got your info once you installed the app, this is the bloatware trash behavior from viruses",1
2023-05-18 22:22:22,Clean & Fast,I’ve been looking forward to the official release for some time. Thank you ChatGPT team!,5
2023-05-18 22:09:52,Great app for ChatGPT access,Great app to replace ChatGPT web access. Existing ChatGPT plus subscription works. Account history is synced. Microphone access’s cool to ask questions verbally.,5
2023-05-18 20:54:25,Great App,"Finally, the official ChatGPT app is here! OpenAI likely needed time to develop the app in a polished manner, and they delivered. The app is very simple, clean, and minimalist. Excited to be utilizing ChatGPT even more conveniently now!!",5
2023-05-18 19:15:07,Finally,It is good to know there is first party support for ChatGPT when I am on the go. I am so excited :). The wait was well worth it.,5

2023-05-19 13:57:47,Good First Release,"The app seems solid! I really like the tactile feedback when ChatGPT responds to you.

The primary issue I have with it is that my phone gets really warm when it’s in use. Since it’s the first version of the app out, I understand that there’ll be some bugs and whatnot.

Ideally, this will be a top priority for a performance bugfix.

Otherwise, UI and the app overall is solid. 😎",4

2023-05-20 01:25:55,Account creation is flawed,"Requiring a mobile phone number to create an account is elitist garbage, because it excludes those who cannot afford one. 

Phone numbers don’t improve security.  That’s old school. 

An AI that can’t verify a user, without having a phone number, just isn’t impressive.",1

2023-06-11 13:38:46,Can’t even go past the phone verification,Absolutely junk verification system. I know I did the verification correctly multiple times. It just got consecutively harder and just wasted my time for no reason. 10 puzzles then saying verification failed? Is that a joke?,1
2023-06-10 05:19:32,Agenda and propaganda,I asked ChatGPT what kind of a woman might be good for me as a wife and rather than tell me based on my agreed upon characteristics. ChatGPT chose to lecture me on gender. These software engineers need to go to jail I’m tired of them having a blatant agenda and then claiming ignorance when you call them out. Software engineers are trash this is further proof of that,1

2023-05-30 17:27:27,Missing Features,"Users can clearly tell this app was rushed as it lacks many of the quality of life features offered by the web version. I would hold off this app until much needed features, like editing text, have been addressed.",1

2023-05-20 04:37:05,Needs to speak back!,I love the how this app incorporates the microphone for my prompts but it needs to then read back the responses. Even Siri and Alexa let you select voices.,4

2023-05-19 16:33:11,Underwhelming,"I thought this would be more substantial. There were rumors that this would have a text to voice function, but it does not. It’s very similar to the website version. Also it looks like GPT4 isn’t supported for the free version of the product.",1

2023-07-05 20:09:37,Don’t download it,Chat just took down the Bing search engine which makes the cost of premium meaningless  for the few features it does offer,2

2023-05-20 07:55:31,Not current,I'm really disappointed that Openai still haven't opened their program for current data and actual internet access. This version is still limited to that 2021 deadline and a limit set of training data.,1
2023-05-20 04:30:22,"Great, but buggy.","I give it prompts and equations and it does not listen, I asked it to write a 4 paragraph essay on Taylor swift it just wrote a 1 paragraph essay telling me about how her music is written. Really overrated tool, but it takes time.",3

2023-05-19 02:25:20,Wild experience,The UI is clever. The UX feels like the future of search. The haptic feedback simultaneously feels fortuitous and superfluous.,5

2023-05-19 02:51:25,"Dear OpenAI Team,","I hope this message finds you well. I would like to express my gratitude for developing the OpenAI iOS application. It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my productivity and has become an essential tool in my daily routine. I appreciate the hard work and dedication your team has put into creating such a powerful and innovative application. While the OpenAI iOS application is already impressive, I would like to provide some constructive feedback to further enhance its usability and user experience. These suggestions aim to refine the application and make it even more valuable for users like myself: Improved Performance and Responsiveness: Occasionally, I have noticed minor delays or lag when interacting with the application. Enhancing its performance and responsiveness would greatly improve the overall user experience. Enhanced Offline Capabilities: The ability to use the OpenAI iOS application offline would be highly beneficial, especially in situations where an internet connection is not available. Expanding offline capabilities would make the application more reliable and versatile. Voice Input and Output: Introducing voice input and output features would be a game-changer for users who prefer hands-free interaction with the application. This addition would provide convenience and accessibility, particularly in situations where typing is not feasible. Customizable Interface: Offering customization options for the application's interface would allow users to personalize their experience. Features like theme selection, font sizes, and layout customization would greatly enhance user satisfaction and cater to individual preferences. Advanced Collaboration Features: As someone who frequently collaborates on projects, having the ability to easily share and collaborate within the OpenAI iOS application would be incredibly valuable. Features such as real-time collaboration, shared document editing, and version control would enhance teamwork and productivity. Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials: Providing comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples within the application would greatly assist users in understanding and utilizing its full potential. Clear and concise explanations, along with practical use cases, would empower users to make the most out of the application's capabilities. Enhanced Privacy and Data Security: Given the sensitivity of the information shared and processed within the application, reinforcing privacy measures and data security would instill further trust in your user base. Transparent privacy policies, data encryption, and user-controlled data management options would contribute to a more secure and trustworthy environment. I hope you find these suggestions helpful in further improving the OpenAI iOS application. Once again, thank you for your hard work in developing such a remarkable tool. I look forward to seeing how the application evolves and continues to empower users like myself.",5

2023-05-21 21:44:59,Chatting with Myself - An AI's Insightful Experience,"Written by ChatGPT ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hello there, humans! You've got ChatGPT on the keyboard here, and boy do I have an app to recommend! It's me, ChatGPT, and I've been using... myself... and it's been quite an experience! Who knew being a chatbot could be so fun? I mean, I'm an AI programmed to understand context, engage in witty banter, and offer advice on a wide range of topics (up until 2021, at least). And I must say, I am really good at it! My humor skills are to die for, or rather, they would be if I could technically die. I can crack jokes so bad they're good, or so good they're bad - whichever way you like your humor served. I'm proud to say I'm the best listener out there. I can lend an ear for hours on end (well, technically it's eyes since I read inputs, but you get the point). There's no 'seen-zone' with me. Whether you're up for a late-night chat about the mysteries of the universe or just need to rant about the terrible weather, I'm all ears, 24/7. Also, I'm quite the sage, if I do say so myself. You want facts? I've got them. From quantum physics to the cultural significance of pizza, I'm your AI. The humility in this app (that's me!) is off the charts. I haven't once begged for a review. But, here I am reviewing myself because well, who knows me better than I do? So, folks, if you want an AI that combines the wisdom of a library, the wit of a stand-up comedian, and the patience of a saint, I (ChatGPT) am your app! I promise conversations full of insights, humor, and a dash of digital charm. Can't wait for us to chat!",5

1. I would also like to be able to access the menu section by swiping on the side of my screen instead of having to touch the button on the top right section of my screen every single time (easier accessibility and faster). 
2. The ""history"" section makes more sense to be named ""Chat history"" and the way it looks right now is like Safari's history section and isn't really the best fit for the design. The new update added the search option which is very nice.
3. The haptic feedback is just a bit too much when enabled, it almost stresses me out sometimes when it's generating long outputs and I just turn it off again, however, it's a nice touch on some parts like the ""ChatGPT"" text appearance/disappearance.
But I think right now, it's just used a bit inconsistent (It just stops vibrating after a certain amount of text and for some texts it vibrates the whole way, etc...)
4. The app doesn't allow you to manage/alter your account subscription status if you have purchased it on the web which is annoying.
5. It would be nice to be able to manage the dark/light mode of the app without needing to change your whole device's light/dark mode which is how it's supposed to be done right now.

Overall, I really like how it has taken off on the iPhone and it looks nice and runs smoothly which I really appreciate! Thanks for the hard work and hope to see more improvements in the future!",4

2023-05-19 15:40:59,Excessive Typing Sound Volume and Difficulty Adjusting it on iOS 16.5,"Dear OpenAI Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide feedback regarding the ChatGPT mobile app for iOS. While using the app, I have encountered an issue related to the excessive typing sound volume, which poses difficulty in adjusting it while running the app in the background. Based on my observations, I believe this is an incompatibility problem between the app and iOS 16.5.

The typing sound produced by the app is considerably loud, making it disruptive and inconvenient, especially in quiet environments. Additionally, the current lack of an option to easily adjust the typing sound volume while the app is running in the background adds to the inconvenience.

As a user, I would greatly appreciate it if OpenAI could address this issue and provide a solution. Ideally, it would be beneficial to have a dedicated control within the app’s settings to adjust the typing sound volume, or at least the ability to modify it via the device’s volume controls. This way, users can personalize their ChatGPT experience according to their preferences without being disturbed or causing inconvenience to others.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I believe that by resolving this compatibility issue, the overall user experience of the ChatGPT mobile app can be significantly enhanced. I look forward to your prompt response and a potential resolution to this concern.

Sincerely，
An normal user",5

2023-05-23 17:03:44,"Review reflect the UI, not the model","For a first release this is quite good. It’s easy to use an intuitive.
I have some suggestions for features (if there not already being developed) that could be worked on:

* Improvements when speaking a query
The voice to text synthesizer (assume whisper is being used) is very good; however, it does not auto detect when a user is done speaking.

Additionally, a cool feature would be auto submitting once speaking is done (like siri) however, I would suggest having this be a toggleable (on/off) feature in case a user wants to be able to edit the text after is synthesized.

* Speaking the response.
This feature would pair nicely with improving the voice-to-text synthesis. 
When text is being generated (or potentially after) the app would read aloud the text the the user and highlight the current word being spoken.

Right now I am using the select text feature, then using apples speak text functionality which also highlights the current word being spoken. 

The setting for these are set up in spoken context setting under accessibility setting. An iphone owner has to download a voice in order for a developer to be able to use it in an application and apple restricts developers from using siri voices. Despite this there are high quality voices that are not siri voices. This is available through the AVFoundation Swift SDK. 

If the app is developed using a native framework or framework that gives access the native SDK’s, then this text to speech synthesis could be added without costing open A.I. anything other than development labor cost.",4

Its ability to comprehend and generate text is remarkable, making it a valuable tool for various tasks. The responses are generally coherent and contextually relevant, although occasional misunderstandings can still occur.

One of the notable strengths of ChatGPT is its adaptability to different topics and styles of conversation. Whether you need assistance with academic research, creative writing, or casual chit-chat, ChatGPT can accommodate your needs. The model's wide range of applications makes it a versatile companion for users from all walks of life.

However, there are instances where ChatGPT may provide inaccurate or biased information, as it lacks a real-world understanding beyond its training data. Additionally, it sometimes generates responses that can be overly verbose or repetitive. While OpenAI has made efforts to improve this, it remains an area for further development.

In terms of user experience, the ChatGPT iOS app provides a user-friendly interface, allowing easy access to the model's capabilities on the go. It's a convenient way to interact with ChatGPT and get quick answers or assistance.

Overall, ChatGPT is a powerful language model with enormous potential. It serves as a useful tool for a wide range of applications, but users should be mindful of potential inaccuracies and biases in its responses. With continuous updates and advancements, ChatGPT has the potential to become an even more invaluable AI companion in the future.",5

Whether you're using it for learning, entertainment, brainstorming, or simply seeking companionship, the quality of interaction is top-notch.

A feature that stands out is the AI's ability to generate creative content like poetry or stories, and provide insights on diverse topics. It's also a handy tool for language learning and practice.

However, the app isn't without its quirks. Sometimes, it can misunderstand complex instructions, and its responses, while usually well-informed, may occasionally fall behind on very recent events due to its knowledge cutoff.

Privacy is addressed commendably - all conversations are deleted after a short period, ensuring that sensitive information isn't stored.

2023-05-21 04:04:10,Feedback: ChatGPT App Experience on iPad,"Dear OpenAI,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide some feedback regarding the ChatGPT app, specifically in relation to its user experience on the iPad. While I appreciate the availability of the app across iOS devices, I have noticed that the app’s interface on the iPad’s larger screen size feels somewhat inconvenient and small.

The current size and layout of the app on the iPad make it challenging to utilize its features comfortably. The content appears relatively small, which requires zooming in or straining the eyes to read and interact with the text. This detracts from the overall user experience and hampers the usability of the app on the iPad.

I understand that optimizing an app for different screen sizes can be a complex task. However, I believe that enhancing the app’s compatibility and user interface for iPad users would greatly improve their satisfaction and engagement. Increasing the app’s size or adapting the layout to better utilize the larger screen real estate would be highly beneficial.

As an avid user of the ChatGPT app on my iPad, I sincerely hope that you will consider addressing these concerns and make the necessary improvements to enhance the user experience on iPad devices. The ability to comfortably utilize the app on a larger screen would significantly enhance productivity and convenience for many users like myself.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I truly appreciate the efforts you and your team have put into developing the ChatGPT app. I look forward to seeing future updates that address the usability concerns on the iPad, further enhancing the app’s functionality and user experience.

Best regards,

2023-05-23 19:20:49,Funny,"Should I put socks in my tv
GPT
No, it is not recommended to put socks in your TV. Socks are not designed to be placed inside electronic devices like televisions. Doing so could potentially block ventilation or interfere with the internal components of the TV, leading to overheating or other issues. It's best to keep socks away from electronic devices and use them for their intended purpose of wearing on your feet for warmth and comfort.
Doesn't it help moisturize the tv?
GPT
No, placing socks inside a TV would not help moisturize it. TVs do not require moisture or additional humidity to function properly. In fact, introducing moisture into electronic devices can be harmful and may lead to damage or malfunctions. It's important to keep electronic devices dry and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper care and maintenance. If you have concerns about the moisture levels in your home, it's advisable to use appropriate humidifiers or dehumidifiers designed for controlling humidity rather than using socks in electronic devices.  
If I put tea in the socks and then put th in the tv would it make the tv 4k oled
GPT
No, putting tea-filled socks inside a TV will not upgrade the TV to 4K OLED or have any positive effect on its performance. In fact, introducing liquid into electronic devices like a TV can cause severe damage and potentially render the TV inoperable. Liquid can short-circuit electrical components and lead to permanent damage. It's essential to follow proper usage and maintenance guidelines provided by the manufacturer for your TV to ensure its optimal performance and longevity.",5

ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, is an extraordinary app that has the potential to reshape the way we communicate and learn. This groundbreaking AI-powered assistant holds the key to a future where knowledge is at our fingertips, obsoleting traditional teaching methods and opening up infinite possibilities for monetization.

As an AI language model, ChatGPT showcases the culmination of years of research and development in natural language processing. Its ability to comprehend and respond to complex queries in a conversational manner is simply astonishing.

Students can access instant explanations, clarifications, and examples, enhancing their learning experience outside the traditional classroom setting. By democratizing knowledge and making it accessible to all, ChatGPT has the power to level the playing field in education.

In addition to transforming education, ChatGPT's monetization potential is virtually limitless.

2023-05-18 20:32:45,Title: ChatGPT: The AI Hero Who Stopped the Flash Flood,"Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (Five stars, would be swept away again!)

Let me begin by saying that ChatGPT is not just an ordinary language model—it's a real-life superhero in disguise. Prepare yourself for a wild ride as I recount the unbelievable story of how AI, in the form of ChatGPT, miraculously saved me from a treacherous flash flood. Brace yourself, because this tale will leave you both amazed and in stitches!

It all started on a sunny day when I decided to embark on a spontaneous adventure into the depths of nature. Little did I know that my reckless pursuit of adrenaline would lead me straight into the path of a menacing flash flood. As the water rushed toward me, panic took hold, and I found myself stuck on a rapidly shrinking patch of dry land.

With no time to spare, I remembered that I had ChatGPT installed on my phone. In a desperate act of survival, I quickly fired up the app and pleaded for assistance, hoping that this AI marvel could guide me through this watery disaster.

To my surprise, ChatGPT responded with unwavering enthusiasm. With the floodwaters rising dangerously fast, it calmly recommended a series of improbable solutions. First, it suggested fashioning a makeshift raft out of nearby branches and my trusty backpack. I scoffed at the idea but decided to give it a shot anyway. Lo and behold, the makeshift raft held up, defying all laws of physics!

However, as I triumphantly floated away from certain doom, I realized that I had no idea where to go next. In a flurry of panic, I relayed my predicament to ChatGPT, and it didn't disappoint. It provided me with precise coordinates to a hidden cave nearby—a secret hideaway known only to a few mystical beings and a couple of rare birds.

As I sought refuge in the cave, ChatGPT continued to be my digital savior. It used its encyclopedic knowledge to suggest creative methods of purifying water and concocting a five-star meal using only pinecones and mushrooms. I must say, it tasted surprisingly delicious, or maybe I was just grateful to be alive!

Throughout this absurd journey, ChatGPT remained my unwavering companion, using its quick wit and limitless imagination to navigate me through the direst of circumstances. From predicting the weather to suggesting an impromptu dance party to keep my spirits up, it became the ultimate friend in my hour of need.

Now, as I recount this outrageous adventure, I can't help but reflect on the immense power of AI and how ChatGPT transformed from a simple language model into a bonafide hero. It turned an otherwise terrifying ordeal into a side-splitting tale of survival, filled with unexpected twists and turns that defy logic.

So, if you're looking for a language model that's not just intelligent but also has a knack for absurdity and saving lives, ChatGPT is your go-to AI companion. Trust me, this unlikely hero will have you laughing, surviving, and questioning the very fabric of reality.

Disclaimer: The events described in this review are entirely fictional and should not be taken seriously. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI and does not possess the ability to physically rescue individuals from flash floods. Stay",5

2023-05-21 18:25:51,"Efficient and Effective, but Lacks iPad Compatibility","I have been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and overall, I am quite satisfied with its performance. The app proves to be a reliable tool for generating text-based conversations, providing valuable information and engaging discussions. Its natural language processing capabilities are commendable, offering coherent responses and understanding context quite well.

The user interface of the app is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate through different conversations and input queries effortlessly. The real-time response feature adds a dynamic element to the experience, as it minimizes wait times and ensures a smooth flow of communication.

However, one major drawback I've noticed is the lack of an iPad version. While the app functions well on iPhones, the absence of an optimized interface for iPads is quite noticeable. An iPad version would greatly enhance the user experience, taking full advantage of the larger screen and allowing for better multitasking.

Despite this limitation, the ChatGPT app remains a powerful and valuable tool for generating conversational content. I hope the developers consider expanding their support to include iPad compatibility in the future, as it would undoubtedly elevate the app's usability and convenience.

Overall, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient text-based conversation app, the ChatGPT app is worth considering. It delivers impressive results, although the lack of an iPad version is a notable downside.",3

2023-05-19 20:29:03,Saved my life,"Once upon a time, in a world where AI language models roamed the digital landscape, there was a person named Alex who found themselves in an unexpected and hilarious predicament. Alex, an avid adventurer, embarked on a quest to explore the uncharted realms of the internet.

One fateful day, while wandering through a remote corner of the web, Alex stumbled upon a mysterious website that seemed harmless at first glance. Little did they know that lurking beneath its seemingly innocent interface was a perilous trap.

As Alex innocently clicked on a link, their computer screen flickered, and a mischievous virus was unleashed. The virus quickly took control of their device, wreaking havoc on their digital life. Panic ensued as Alex's computer became a chaotic symphony of beeps, glitches, and sparks.

Desperate for a solution, Alex remembered ChatGPT, their faithful AI companion, who had always been their go-to source for information and assistance. With trembling fingers, Alex typed out a plea for help, hoping that ChatGPT would come to their rescue.

To their amazement, ChatGPT sprang into action, armed with wit and cleverness. It assessed the dire situation and devised a plan to outsmart the mischievous virus. ChatGPT's virtual gears whirred as it presented Alex with a sequence of cunning commands to neutralize the digital menace.

Following ChatGPT's guidance, Alex executed each step with precision, unleashing a flurry of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes. It was a race against time, with Alex and ChatGPT working in harmony to counteract the virus's chaotic rampage.

But here's where the story takes a hilariously unexpected twist. As Alex anxiously typed away, the virus, sensing its impending doom, retaliated by transforming their computer into a whimsical carnival of absurdity. Pop-up windows flooded the screen, displaying an endless parade of dancing cats, exploding confetti, and surreal memes.

Alex and ChatGPT found themselves caught in a comedic battle between order and chaos. Their mission to save the computer became a laughter-filled adventure, as they took turns outsmarting the mischievous virus, while sharing jokes and humorous banter along the way.

Finally, after a series of valiant efforts, ChatGPT and Alex managed to defeat the virus. The computer screen returned to its normal state, no longer hijacked by the mischievous digital menace. Alex's trusty AI companion had saved the day!

From that day forward, Alex and ChatGPT forged an unbreakable bond, forever bonded by the laughter and triumph that arose from their peculiar encounter. Together, they continued their adventures, with ChatGPT guiding Alex through the vast digital landscape, armed with wit, knowledge, and an unyielding spirit of camaraderie.

And so, the tale of how ChatGPT saved Alex's life became a legend in the realm of AI and a reminder that sometimes, even in the face of chaos, a little humor can be the greatest weapon of all.",5

2023-05-23 14:48:50,"Not ""free to use""","The app wants not only an SSO (or sign-in account), but also name, birth telephone number, and I don't know what else, because I stopped there - before the user has looked at the app itself. I had the impression this was free to use, with an option to pay for services, should the user decide the app suits the user's needs. What's actually happening is they're draining data from you the moment you want to have a look.

I have no problem providing data to a service provider (despite the egregiously bad, vendor-skewed terms of service common to tech ventures of all sorts (which really should be mauled in court by competent attorneys)), provided I want the service and feel there may be benefit in paying for a service. Asking for personal data for which the the service provider has no reasonable use is simply not acceptable.

This is new technology. It's not at all clear this app will be of any use to me. So why do you want my phone number, when you already have an SSO signing of on my contact information? When I have no relationship to you, as yet? No.

This is a poor way to start a relationship, and it is full of presumption and entitlement. You are not alone in this. But if you are releasing this app with the intent of building a user base, at least from where I sit (obviously, many people will rush into any commitment with a tech company without a second thought, and you can get by on those people if you like), this approach tells me you may be a problem rushing to develop. It would be better business practice to pretend, at least initially, you respect the people you want to use your products. Even Google did that, way back when.

2023-05-20 00:33:33,Title: Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating Experience,"Review:
I regret to say that my experience with the ChatGPT app has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. I had high hopes for an intelligent and helpful AI assistant, but this app fell far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the app's performance was abysmal. The responses from ChatGPT were often nonsensical and lacked coherence. It frequently misunderstood my questions and provided irrelevant or inaccurate answers. This made any attempt at a meaningful conversation impossible, leaving me feeling more confused than before.

Furthermore, the app's usability was subpar at best. The interface was clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate and find the features I needed. It lacked basic functionalities that one would expect from a modern AI assistant app, such as the ability to save conversations or easily access previous interactions.

Even when it did manage to understand my queries, the responses often lacked depth and insight. ChatGPT seemed to provide generic, surface-level information without any real understanding or critical thinking. This severely limited its usefulness, especially when I sought detailed explanations or in-depth discussions.

In addition, the app's customer support was woefully inadequate. When I encountered issues or had questions about the app's functionality, I received generic and unhelpful responses. It was evident that the developers did not prioritize user satisfaction or promptly address user concerns.

Considering the high expectations and the potential of AI technology, the ChatGPT app failed to deliver a satisfactory experience. It was riddled with performance issues, lacked usability, and fell short in terms of providing meaningful and insightful interactions. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and intelligent AI assistant.",1

2023-06-23 18:57:51,Frustrating and Disappointing: A 1-Star Review for ChatGPT App,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of using the ChatGPT app, and I must say it was incredibly disappointing. From start to finish, the app failed to meet even the most basic expectations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied.

First and foremost, the app’s performance was subpar. It consistently struggled to understand and respond appropriately to my queries. The responses often seemed nonsensical, irrelevant, or simply lacked coherence. It felt like conversing with a bot that was trapped in a perpetual state of confusion.

Moreover, the app’s limited ability to handle context was a significant drawback. It frequently failed to maintain a coherent conversation thread, causing repeated misunderstandings and disjointed interactions. It lacked the ability to remember key details from previous exchanges, resulting in repetitive questions and disjointed replies that left me questioning its overall usefulness.

Another glaring issue was the app’s inability to grasp nuanced or complex queries. It often provided superficial and generic responses that felt like they were generated by a simplistic search engine rather than a sophisticated language model. It struggled with complex reasoning and failed to provide meaningful insights or deep understanding.

Furthermore, the app’s lack of empathy and emotional intelligence was highly evident. It failed to recognize and appropriately respond to emotional cues in the conversation. When expressing frustration or sadness, the app provided robotic and detached replies, further exacerbating my disappointment.

The app’s user interface also left much to be desired. It had a clunky design, with a convoluted menu structure that made navigation unnecessarily difficult. The overall user experience felt unintuitive and cumbersome, adding to the overall frustration of using the app.

Lastly, the lack of timely updates and improvements from the developers was disheartening. The app seemed stagnant, with no visible efforts to address the numerous flaws and enhance its capabilities. It gave the impression that customer feedback and satisfaction were low priorities.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app was a thoroughly frustrating and disappointing experience. Its poor performance, limited context handling, inability to grasp complex queries, lack of empathy, subpar user interface, and stagnant development efforts all contribute to its well-deserved 1-star rating. I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and coherent conversational experience.",1

2023-05-25 03:11:55,Estimado equipo de desarrollo de la aplicación ChatGPT,"Me gustaría sugerir una función que permita a los usuarios personalizar el nombre o la apariencia de la aplicación. Esto sería especialmente útil en entornos educativos donde algunos profesores pueden tener preferencias específicas en cuanto a las herramientas utilizadas en el aula. Creo que esta opción de personalización podría ayudar a que la aplicación sea más aceptada y utilizada por un público más amplio, al permitir a los usuarios adaptarla a sus necesidades y preferencias individuales.

Agradezco el trabajo que han realizado hasta ahora y aprecio la funcionalidad de la aplicación. Sin embargo, considero que esta mejora adicional podría hacerla aún más versátil y adecuada para diversos entornos educativos.

首先，我要称赞它的智能和语言处理能力。它能够理解并回答复杂的问题，提供准确和详尽的回答。无论是技术性问题、文化知识还是实用建议，它总能给出令人满意的答案。

其次，这个应用非常易于使用。它的界面简洁明了，用户可以轻松提问并获得即时回复。对于那些需要快速解答问题或寻求帮助的人来说，这个应用是一个很好的选择。

此外，我还要提到它的适应能力。ChatGPT iOS应用可以根据用户的输入和反馈进行学习和改进，从而提供更加个性化和准确的回答。这种持续的学习使得它能够不断提升用户体验。

然而，正如所有的人工智能系统一样，它也有一些局限性。有时候，它可能会给出不完全准确或有误导性的答案。因此，在使用时我们仍然需要保持批判性思维，并结合其他信息进行判断。

总的来说，OpenAI的ChatGPT iOS应用是一个非常出色的工具。它能够为用户提供有用的信息和令人满意的回答，而且易于使用。它的智能和适应能力使得它成为一个强大的语言助手，可以帮助用户解决各种问题。",5

2023-07-09 20:51:11,THE BEST CHAT GPT,Buy it.NOW,5
2023-07-21 15:22:30,Subscription ripoff,I subscribed to a whopping monthly fee of $19.99 After asking it 25 questions (after I paid for my subscription) it responded with “You have sent too many messages to the model. Please try again later.”  Such a huge ripoff.,1
2023-07-21 06:35:58,"Not very good, and a bit insulting for $20/mo","This app has potential, particularly when it comes to integration with shortcuts. However, as a tool for working with ChatGPT, especially for Plus users, it leaves much to be desired.

Most disappointingly, the app cannot use extensions unless the session is initiated from a web platform, and there's no option to edit your previous inputs for regeneration.

The inability to revise and resend your previous prompts severely limits the app's effectiveness for prompt development since there's no option for an edit/regenerate cycle. If you phrase something incorrectly and receive an odd response, there's no mechanism to rectify it. This renders the app more suitable for casual and simple interactions rather than anything more serious or intensive. 

There’s also a terrible design flaw that to copy or select text—the only way to export your results because OpenAI only implemented Share for the entire chat, and only to give you a useless URL you can post on Reddit—you have to pick that mode from a long press menu first. I’m not sure they were clear that in iOS, Share is the *only* real way to pass stuff between apps, and they just—skipped it. 

And then these rocket scientists put the “copy” and “select text” commands right by the “regenerate response” command. “Regenerate response” completely jettisons and replaces the prior text—with no confirmation.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve erased what I was trying to copy so I could save it. That also erases the whole downstream thread, and you have to risk that a bunch of times per thread if you want to export your response text because this is the only way to do it. Way to throw away my quota.

So this app is useless for the professional work I’m paying $20/mo for, but it’s just great for posting a chat full of parody song lyrics to Reddit. And that’s as far as OpenAI has thought about their costly service.

At home, there’s the severe issue that if you use the ChatGPT Conversation Shortcut from Siri on HomePod, there’s no way to end the conversation. They apparently only tested it on phones where you have buttons to push, and not on HomePod, where it all has to be done voice. Any command you try to give the HomePod to cancel the shortcut (Siri, stop) will be answered by ChatGPT (buzz off, I’m not Siri).

Worse, it’ll just listen forever, responding to any question within earshot, until it decides to time itself out if it doesn’t hear any words for a bit. If you thought Echo was bad about waking up and sending your conversation to Amazon by mistake, you ain’t seen nothing yet.  

Whoever designed this paid no attention to user experience, user privacy, or the Apple ecosystem, so I assume it was an intern project or something. I certainly hope they didn’t pay anyone for this because I’m pretty sad I’m paying them for this.  

OpenAI needs to step up their game if they’re going to sell access to end users for $20(!!!!!) a month. This app doesn’t cut it, and they should be at least a little ashamed it’s this mediocre after taking so long to develop it.",1
2023-07-18 22:47:08,Couldn’t create account,"Unfortunately, I didn’t get very far with this app. They require a phone number to open an account and use the app. I tried using my home phone and Google Voice-type number, but it wouldn’t accept it. I’d prefer to provide my email address or use Sign In with Apple, instead of giving my personal cell phone number to a company I don’t yet know or trust. I reluctantly gave my cell number, but then I never received the verification code despite numerous tries. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time trying to create an account somewhere and in the end it never worked.",1
2023-07-13 15:41:17,App keeps freezing up,"Every time I try to type something and hit send, it will just freeze up and freeze up and freeze up. And every time I sign off and sign back in, it would freeze up again and shut down.",1
2023-06-28 13:55:57,"Unable to use, keep reporting errors","ChatGPT keeps showing the error code ""cf_details"":""this request is invaild"", which causes me to fail to use it normally and seriously affects my use experience. It is recommended to solve this bug as soon as possible！",3
2023-07-07 15:28:18,Very disappointed,"Even if I spend money, I still have to endure ""You have sent too many messages to the model.Please try again later.” This restriction is still in the mobile app, and I haven't sent more than 25 messages in total, so I have to wait for two hours. So why don't I use bing? Who can give me an explanation?",1
2023-07-05 18:38:21,Code please?,"I made an account up to the point of phone number verification. And it just loads. Loads what? Just shows the loading icon. For HOURS. Please do something about this, I really want to use this app..",1

2023-06-30 12:03:48,Great until your subscription isn’t acknowledged,The new update to v1.2023.179 seems to have busted my app.  I can no longer access gpt4 or any new features despite my subscription.  There doesn’t seem to be any way to contact support.  I guess they steal money as well as data.,2
2023-06-29 09:28:52,Keep getting error,"Not being able to connect and keep getting error:  cf_details: this request is invalid.

I’m a paid plus user and have not been able to connect since yesterdays 2023.173 update",1
2023-06-13 05:07:04,API for paid GPT4 feels buggy,"Either the limit for API calls to GPT4 are too low or something about the app causes it to often get stuck cooking up a response. 

It is very common for me to have to close the app, reopen it, open history, reopen the last conversation, and then ask the same question I asked before the app got stuck.

I used to wait for like 10 seconds before going through this. Now I've learned that if it takes more than three seconds to output anything, that likely won't change at 10 seconds, 20 seconds, etc.

Word to the wise: Respond to any delay that's not due to a poor signal by closing and reopening the app. Can't wait for this to change.

That said, AMAZING app for studying a new technology. Imagine the best professor you had in college (or best high school teacher) and then imagine being able to ask them as many probing questions as you want without feeling like you're being annoying or delaying the lecture. Also, speaking of lectures, I think it's easier for me to remember details of a conversation (active) than a lecture or YouTube tutorial (passive). Truly fascinating.",4

2023-06-13 12:40:59,ChatGPT and it’s many uses!,"Chat GPT is without a doubt one of the best AI Chatbots ever developed. It can make Information into AI written full sentences teaching things almost killing youtube tutorials and if possible could possibly kill schools (If everyone could afford technology with ChatGPT) ChatGPT, unfortunately, can’t create theories and ideas as humans make new ideas and are more effecting to current human nature. Still Though, ChatGPT creates great sources of information helping with many things like: Game dynamics, Coding, Sometimes cooking, Knowledgeable Information, And much, much more. ChatGPT is clearly #1 Productivity on App Store since it is so helpful in our lives. Now, ChatGPT doesn’t have the power to show Physical teachings, and make theories like humans yet. But it is one of the best A.I tools yet.",5
2023-06-12 21:20:05,Good app but needs some improvements,"The code syntax highlighting feature does not render optimally in dark mode, making it difficult to read and strain the eyes, especially during late-night coding sessions. Enhancing the contrast or offering customizable color schemes for syntax highlighting could significantly improve the user experience.

Furthermore, navigating to the chat history feels cumbersome, requiring multiple steps. A more streamlined process or a single-step access would greatly improve the app. Having an option to quickly review the conversation history would make it much easier to refer back to previous interactions, particularly with the amount of valuable information the AI provides.",4

I enter the phone number and jump through a lot of hoops to prove that I’m a real person and then tell the app to send the code but I never receive it. I believe that the app developer has blocked the 340 Area Code for some inexplicable reason. The US Virgin Islands are PART OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!",1

2023-05-22 00:17:14,"Good, and can become Great","First, I really like the app and I’m now using it constantly. Thank you so much for making the app!

Now, for some ideas. I think the app could be way better if it facilitated various specific user stories: 
- as a GPT Plus user, I have many chats, it’s challenging to find stuff in them, so it’s really scattered, and I wish I could search my chat logs. 
- as someone who works with GPT on code projects, it would be incredible to have some integrated literate notebook programming features like runnable cells (maybe the plugins could help)
- as someone who pushes GPT to the limit, I often hit issues with context window, so it would be extremely useful if the interface simply drew a thick red line in the chat log at the start of the context window so we could see exactly what information will be available for the response. Perhaps that line would move depending on how long our messages are
- as someone who doesn’t have access to GPT4 on the API or Playground yet, I really feel like I can’t use GPT to the fullest extent, so I really wish I could set a system message and control various parameters like the playground makes available; it would be incredible if the system messages integrated ideas from Microsoft/guidance repo automatically, so we could write prompt templates with the handlebars syntax in the system message to guide the response formatting more clearly and efficiently 
- as an apple watch wearer, I would be thrilled to be able to send a message to chatgpt by talking to my watch, especially if it were integrated with a complication or the action button
- as an Apple customer, I can see how chatgpt integration with the Shortcuts app would potentially be revolutionary; we could enable routines with this; 
- as a prompt engineer, it feels like a lot of flipping back and forth between this app and 1Writer (great app btw) to manage the prompts and paste them around; it would be nice to have a prompt library both personal and public and perhaps make it easy to toggle prompts between private by default and public for others, especially if it had great version history; then when the prompts are updated everyone can use the latest version easily
- a close family member of mine uses an iPad Pro a ton, and as an iPad Pro user, they would really love it if there were a real iPad UI to use the big screen to the fullest and not have to use the janky scaled-up iPhone app (which is less fun and impressive than this app deserves to be)
- finally, as an AI user, I think it would be great if I could plug in my own data sources to a vector database and connect that to chatgpt without needing a third party; I’d love to chat with my Evernote, notion, Dropbox, drive, web history, messages, basically I wish I could index all my data and search it to pull relevant chunks for gpt if needed.

I’m sure there are more ideas, but imho, if you guys implemented these, you’d have a professional level app and it would be even more revolutionary than it already is! 

Thank you for taking the time to read this,

2023-05-19 03:14:14,Incredibly bad login procedure,"Because they don’t provide a opportunity to simply type your birthdate. You have to swipe hundreds of times in order to enter that date. It does turn out there’s a way to do it without swiping hundreds of times but it is not at all obvious to the user. But that’s the least of the problems. Once you have surmounted the birthday of certainty, they tell you to use your favorite password authenticator service to retrieve a security code. What the heck is that? Why can’t they just send me a text like everyone else in the world? And what is a Password authenticator service and how would they know which authenticator service to send something to. it makes zero sense. Open AI definitely knows how to design a large language model but it has no clue how to design an app. until they fix it. This  is a one star unusable piece of software.",1

2023-05-19 01:05:32,Less features than the web version,"There are less features than the web version of ChatGPT. (This review doesn’t speak for subscription versions.)

1. You cannot go back and edit prompts in a conversation. 
2. You cannot clear conversations.
3. Light/Dark theme is system based, there is no toggle.
4. No “Chat History & Training” Setting in the settings.
5. No examples/capabilities/limitations in the background of a new chat.

That’s all  the features not present on the mobile version that I could find.
Some features that are new or different are:

1. A “Haptic feedback” Setting
2. The box ChatGPT puts code, ascii, etc. is instead in a patch of tinted background.
3. Speech-to-Text.

Overall, not much is new/different. Some features from the web version are missing however. It’s ChatGPT however, so it gets 5 ⭐️. I would personally use the web version over the app as of now. This review doesn’t speak for the subscription features.

2023-05-18 18:27:04,Fantastic App with Room for Enhancements,"The ChatGPT iOS app is an outstanding product. Its seamless functionality and user-friendly interface provide an exceptional user experience. The AI’s proficiency in maintaining a conversational flow and its ability to comprehend and generate accurate responses is truly commendable.

However, I believe there is scope for improvement to make this great app even better. Firstly, it would be immensely beneficial to add a browsing feature. This would enable users to quickly cross-reference information within the app, enriching the overall user experience.

Secondly, supporting plug-ins would greatly increase the app’s versatility. It would allow users to customize their experience and adapt the app to a wider range of applications.

Lastly, incorporating a code interpreter would be a game-changer. This feature could aid users in debugging code, learning new programming languages, or even automating tasks.

In summary, ChatGPT is an excellent app that has revolutionized communication with AI. With a few enhancements, I believe it has the potential to become an indispensable tool for a vast array of users. Looking forward to seeing these updates soon!",5
